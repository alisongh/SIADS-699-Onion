In a poignant moment on his Middle East visit, US President Donald Trump took time out to hide his tax returns from the last twenty years in Jerusalemâ€™s holy Western Wall. While some believed he was filing a building application to have the site demolished and replaced with a Trump Hotel, insiders believe it was actually documents from Inland Revenue proving he had paid no tax. Mr Trump placed the folded up pieces of paper into a crack in the wall, before saying a short prayer to himself. Asked about the moment later, Trump said it was a private moment between him and his wall.
