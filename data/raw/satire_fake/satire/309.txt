A Californian woman severely injured her husband by hitting him at great speed with her SUV, after he confessed that he had voted for Donald Trump in the last presidential election.
Tania Whitmore, a devoted militant for the Hillary Clinton campaign, allegedly used her Ford Escape SUV to trample her husband, Darrell Johnson, after he told her that he’d voted for Trump.
Investigators believe that her vehicle was going at more than 65 miles per hour it hit Mr Johnson, around 7:30 this morning. After the collision, it changed direction and ended up crashing into a large tree.
Officers of the San Diego Police Department rapidly arrived on the site, and were fortunately able to arrest her before she had time to finish her spouse.
“I’d forgiven him for cheating on me with both my sister and my best friend, but this was too much!” she shouted after her arrest. “The jerk deserved to die!”
Mr Johnson was rapidly transported at the UC San Diego Health Center, where he remains in a critical but stable condition.
The surprising result of the last presidential election is causing a lot of tension across the United States, and this violent incident seems to be just another manifestation of the generalized discomfort surrounding Donald Trump’s victory.
Protesters hit the streets again on Sunday, marking the fifth day of demonstrations in cities such as New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
Protesters are upset about Trump’s policies on health care, the environment, LGBT rights and other issues.
Many protesters are questioning the legitimacy of Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton by noting that although he took the Electoral College, Clinton won the popular vote by a large margin.
