Don Jr.’s latest excuse for meeting with the Kremlin attorney was to see if he could import Russian babies and sell them in the United States.
 
“Do you know how hard it is to buy a white baby in America? I would be helping infertile couples out by providing this nifty service to them - and making owning a child easy-peasy for the top one-percenters who are just too busy living a life of luxury to be wasting their time on nine months of pregnancy. The rich, and slightly less rich, will be so grateful to us for coming to their rescue. It’s what being a good Christian is all about - family values. Children, like everything else in the world, have a price tag on their heads. We were thinking of calling our
for-profit charity, From Russia With Love."
