Guam authorities have arrested Kim Li Sun who is allegedly a spy for the North Korean regime reports the Guam Times this week.
The 41-year-old agent of the Pyongyang regime is said to have given himself up to authorities and does not wish to return to North Korea.
It is after allegedly living in a “free democratic society” under cover as a spy that he realized that he never wanted to go back to North Korea.
“He told us that life in North Korea is a living Hell and that he would do anything he could to never go back” explained Guam police spokesman, Henry Xian to reporters.
“He said that it’s while eating ice cream that he decided to surrender to Guam to local authorities, because he had never tasted something so good in his entire life and that it tasted like Heaven” he concluded, visibly amused.
A taste of Heaven
The extreme poverty in which the North Korean people live could explain the actions of the spy according to North Korean political expert, Andrew Lee Gibbons.
“The abject state of poverty in which the North Korean people live is horrendous” he explains.
“Basic food supplies are frequently lacking and the people are constantly living in a permanent state of famine. Ice cream, chocolate or even sugar are luxury items reserved for the elite of the regime” he added.
North Korea leader Kim Jong Un appears to have backed away from a threat to fire missiles towards the US Pacific territory of Guam, opting instead to wait and see what the “foolish Yankees” do next.
