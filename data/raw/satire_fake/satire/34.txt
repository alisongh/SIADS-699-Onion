Republicans are not fans of the Black Lives Matter movement, which sprang up a few years ago to protest police violence against the black community. However, it seems some Republicans believe the group is collaborating with America’s enemies. A new poll by Occidental Public Polling said that 65 percent of Republicans believed Black Lives Matter was working with ISIS. The OPP survey interviewed 1,000 Republicans by phone and the internet. These views are not surprising because this is a message constantly repeated on right-wing media. According to The Washington Post, Mike Halstead, a police chief in Surf City, N.C., was fired after he posted this message on his Facebook profile: “This Black Lives Matter group is nothing more than an American born terrorist group brought on by the lie of the hands up don’t shoot during the criminal thug Michael Brown incident.” He also repeated the message on FOX News. FOX News commentators Bill O’Reilly and Sean Hannity have both compared Black Lives Matter to the Ku Klux Klan. However, no Black Lives Matter members have lynched police officers or threatened to blow up their homes.
