The Business Standard news has received another leak from White House insider “Orange Throat,” and things seem to be getting desperate for the Trump administration. Trump recently fired White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer and Chief of State Reince Priebus after about six months in office. Orange Throat said the White House is like “‘Game of Thrones’ with less blood.” Trump also reportedly considered firing White House advisor Steve Bannon, when he started getting more praise than him. According to the Washington Post, an unnamed White House insider also compared the ongoing carnage to HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” “Priebus’ final departure was a humiliating coda for what had been a largely demeaning tenure during which he endured regular belittling from rival advisers — and even, at times, the president himself. His exit was described by one Republican strategist as ‘the red wedding,’ a reference to a mass-murder blood bath episode of HBO’s ‘Game of Thrones,’” said the Post.
