Veteran conservative Pat Buchanan has weighed in on President Donald Trump’s decision to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA,) the program that allowed children who were brought to this country illegally work authorization. In an interview with the Patriot Media Sentinel, Buchanan said it was a necessary evil and a way of protecting European Americans’ future. “The Dreamers have to go to protect the future of our children,” he said. “If we let these people take over, our children will end up working as gardeners and maids for them.” Buchanan has penned several books and articles warning about the dire future of America with a majority brown population. According to Right-Wing Watch, conspiracy theorist Josh Bernstein says deporting the Dreamers was necessary for conservatives’ survival. He said Democrats and Dreamers would eventually create a one-party state and target right-wingers. “They would probably start killing people at some point that disagreed with their positions,” said Bernstein. “Is that far-stretched? Does that seem like it’s way out of whack? That I’m a conspiracy theorist type of person? No, I’m not. I just can see the writing on the wall.”
