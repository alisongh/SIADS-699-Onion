JUST IN: As Trump And The DOJ Reopen Hillary’s Investigation, She Escapes To Another Country!

In light of new events, we have learned that after President Trump instructed the DOJ to reopen Hillary Clinton’s investigation in regards to her email hacking affair, she might be fleeing the country.

Where to, one might ask?

Well, as reports suggest, Hillary is packing her back to fly to good ole Canada.

Talk about feeling the need to chill!

Hillary and husband, Bill Clinton will pay a visit to the country, alongside daughter Chelsea and two grandchildren, residing at an estate in Quebec, known as Manoir Hovey.

Whether this is a long-term commitment or a short-term agenda is still unclear, but Hillary does have many reasons to abandon her homeland.

The timing is also immaculate, as Barack Obama decided to also leave for Indonesia, when the Susan rice case reached a boiling point.

After Rice’s testimony was delayed, which must have come as devastating to Obama, who was looking to avoid the drama.

The Democrats sure are travelers by nature!

Once the news of Hillary traveling to Canada broke, the Internet had a blast commenting.Take a look:

Are they seeking asylum ?

While the Hillary investigation is set to kick off, she felt like this was a good time to leave, but has to back to the U.S. for her book publishing, scheduled for September. I guess she left many loose ends, which are now putting her in the inevitable position to face her doings.

One thing is certain- whichever the reason behind Hillary’s getaway, she must be trebling with fear that Trump could actually dig up something never revealed before. And let me tell you something- that is a good reason to be scared!
