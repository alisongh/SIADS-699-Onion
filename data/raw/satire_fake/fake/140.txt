In the days following Hurricane Harvey a photo was taken of a heroic President Donald Trump leaning over the side of a raft, reaching out to a stranded flood victim.

Trump said he was not a hero, just a man wanting to help the victims of the great state of Texas. “Look, I did what i had to do,” said Trump. “They needed a helping hand and I was there to lend one.”
