President Donald Trump is being criticized on a daily basis. Some people just can’t get over the fact that he beat Hillary Clinton. It seems like these people are forgetting that Clinton never had a chance to get any near the Oval Office. Now liberals have been too vocal about their criticism for the President, and it’s all about the ‘covfefe’ word that appeared in one of the latest tweets. Liberals will always have a reason to bash President Trump. First, they hated his campaign, then, they laid their hands on the President’s family. We know that President Trump will always be our favorite, and hopefully, liberals will understand that they can’t do anything to change this.Although President Trump faced harsh criticism, he still stands strong against his enemies. He promised to make America great again, and we can already see the results of his job.President Trump came back from his first official tour overseas. This trip was an absolute success, and the President did an amazing job. World leaders appreciated his presence, and they all honored the President. He enjoyed great respect, and came back with a few important deals. But, President Trump came back with something else. It’s the ‘covfefe’ mystery. For those who don’t know it, ‘covfefe’ means ‘I will stand up.’ Liberals thought that President Trump was dream texting, but they are too ignorant to understand the meaning of his tweet. “Despite the constant negative press covfefe,” President Trump tweeted. He was just trying to say that he’d stand strong for the upcoming events, promising that he will manage to protect the country from everything and everyone. Learn this, liberals.
