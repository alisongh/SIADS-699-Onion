After months of the Obama Administration and the entire left wing media complex denying it, the truth comes out. It’s UNBELIEVABLE or PREDICTABLE depending on present company.

According to CNN:

US investigators wiretapped former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort under secret court orders before and after the election, sources tell CNN, an extraordinary step involving a high-ranking campaign official now at the center of the Russia meddling probe.

The liberal media is shrieking in an attempt to turn the story against Trump by being shocked at the fact a candidate would be spied upon. Totally forgetting the fact that they have spent months spinning the fact that no surveillance ever took place.

So many questions. Was Manafort cooperating to hurt Trump? Why was a FISA warrant issued and who signed off on it?

CNN Continues:

It is unclear when the new warrant started. The FBI interest deepened last fall because of intercepted communications between Manafort and suspected Russian operatives, and among the Russians themselves, that reignited their interest in Manafort, the sources told CNN. As part of the FISA warrant, CNN has learned that earlier this year, the FBI conducted a search of a storage facility belonging to Manafort. It’s not known what they found.

The plot thickens. Stay tuned to see where this twist of events leads.

Blood is in the water…no one can tell yet just whose it is. Only time will tell.
