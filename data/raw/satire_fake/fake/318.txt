Members of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign discussed the political importance of pleasing billionaire George Soros in emails published by WikiLeaks.
The email, among thousands allegedly hacked from Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta, reveals a discussion between several 
prominent figures – including campaign manager Robby Mook and Clinton aide Huma Abedin – regarding the organization “America Votes.”
“I would only do this for political reasons (ie to make Soros happy),” Mook tells Abedin. “It’s very unclear to me how much AV will matter next cycle. 
And I haven’t seen then [sic] adding any value this cycle. I also worry a little it will cause donor confusion vis a vis Priorities.”
America Votes, which works “with over 400 state and national partner organizations to advance progressive policies, win elections, and 
protect every American’s right to vote,” has received millions in funding from Soros.
“She is having dinner with George Soros tonight,” Abedin responds. 
“Do you know much about America Votes? As Greg Speed explained to me, they are the coordinated campaign for various outside groups. 
Soros is a big supporter of the group and hes [sic] going to ask her tonight if she will come to a fundraiser for them at his house in December. Thoughts?”
Several other emails released in the Podesta dump also reveal the Clinton campaign’s close ties with the nefarious philanthropist.
