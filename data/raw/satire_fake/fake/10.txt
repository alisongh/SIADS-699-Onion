VIA| Ah, the infamous tarmac meeting.  You know…the one in which former Attorney General Loretta Lynch met with Bill Clinton…in her airplane…at the Phoenix Airport?  The one after which many people suspected that a “deal” had gone down to get Hillary off the hook? Well…according to a report in the NY Times, FBI Director James Comey may have been in the same corner as those of us who had concerns about Lynch’s objectivity and political bias towards Clinton. From NY Times: At the meeting, everyone agreed that Mr. Comey should not reveal details about the Clinton investigation. But Ms. Lynch told him to be even more circumspect: Do not even call it an investigation, she said, according to three people who attended the meeting. Call it a “matter.”
