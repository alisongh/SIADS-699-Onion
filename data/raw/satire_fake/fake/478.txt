One United States Congressman asked for a body to be dug out with the purpose to complete the investigation by the House Intelligence Committee. Something like this has never happened in our history.

After this request was made, Judge Marmon Watson agreed to it and let the body of Vince Foster be dug out from its grave for the sake of a detailed autopsy by a work crew in Fairfax, Virginia.

This came a few days after the intelligence services found additional evidence for the case in which a murdered reporter had a letter which had written on it ”if anything happens to me…” The letter was delivered to his publication and the most interesting thing about it was that it included Presidential candidate and former State of Secretary Hillary Clinton in an old crime of hers. This happened right after Vince Foster committed a ”suicide”.

His body was removed from the cemetery and is now headed to the Naval Hospital in Norfolk for an autopsy to clear his suspicious death.

Because this subject is very sensitive, South Carolina Representative Trey Gowdy and all the other federal prosecutors keep all information connected to his case top secret.

From the Washington Post:

Depressed and losing sleep after a few months in the White House, Vince Foster became convinced that the turmoil surrounding his work for President Clinton would never stop. He’d already been the subject of a scathing newspaper editorial that had raised questions about his long association with Bill and Hillary Clinton, and his name kept appearing in White House controversies.
