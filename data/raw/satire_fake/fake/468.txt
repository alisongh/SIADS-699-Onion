The Clintons have become known for having a long list of people who died from unknown reasons under suspicious conditions, and were at the same time, either dangerously connected to them, or representing a threat to them. From recently, sadly, the list has one more name on it.

According to Infowars, an ex-Haitian government representative who was supposed to reveal more on Clinton Foundation fraud and violation during the following week was discovered dead in Miami, and as already mentioned, under suspicious circumstances. When he was found dead, Klaus Eberwein had only 50 years.

The editorial reports that the reason of the death is a “gunshot to the head” and this case is officially considered a suicide. Eberwein had stated that he feared for his life as he was louder regarding the illegal and unconstitutional things which were happening in the Clinton Foundation.

The Clinton Foundation, they are criminals, they are thieves, they are liars, they are a disgrace, -he stated while protesting in front of Clinton Foundation’s Manhattan office previous year. This Tuesday, Eberwein was expected to testify in front of the Haitian Senate Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. In the testimony, he was supposed to show how the Clinton Foundation funneled funds raised in a form of Haiti earthquake donations from donors from all around the world.

His relatives, the close family, and his friends all agreed that he would not commit a suicide.

It’s really shocking. We grew up together; he was like family, – stated Gilbert Bailly, Eberwein’s friend.
