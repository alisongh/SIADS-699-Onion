Throughout his campaign, Donald Trump has demonstrated his unwavering support for our troops. This is something that has been missing from the White House for some time now. Recently, Hannity gave a report about Trump that speaks louder than any of his statements could. During the war, Trump reportedly helped 200 stranded Marines who didn’t have a flight home to Florida. Cpl. Ryan Stickney claims that after his unit spent six months in Saudi Arabia, it went to Camp Lejeune in North Carolina before heading home to Miami. Due to a logistics failure, the troops ended up stranded. “The way the story was told to us was that Mr. Trump found out about it and sent the airline down to take care of us,” Stickney commented. “And that’s all we knew…I remember asking ‘Who is Donald Trump?’ I truly didn’t know anything about him.” This is the same person that the media likes to portray as selfish. “It may not seem like much to most people, but it was very important to a bunch of jar heads and more importantly their families waiting for them on the hot tarmac,” he continued. “I have not seen a Clinton or Sanders plane, or anything else for that matter, sent to support the troops.” What do you think of Trump? Is he clearly a man of his word?
