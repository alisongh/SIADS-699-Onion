BREAKING: Obama Brought In For Questioning Over Ties To Barcelona Terrorist

Traitor in Chief and supporter of Muslims Barack Obama was
brought in for questioning at the Hoover FBI Complex in
Washington DC this morning for questioning about his ties to
the Barcelona terrorist. A story arose yesterday about the mass
murderer being Obama’s ??rst cousin and visiting the White
House.

Now, according to Supervisory Special Agent Manny Mans??eld,
the FBI wants to know more:

“This man was brought to Washington DC
seven years ago with his 7th-grade class from
Pakistan. Obama set that up. We need to know
what kind of relationship they had and if
Obama ever gave him any financial support.
Family support is one thing, but if there’s a
large transfer of cash anywhere, there will be
issues.”

Obama, who has always believed he was above the law, snuck
into the building using an underground garage. He is said to
have spent more than three hours in the building, waving to people who recognized him along the way with a smile.

When you’re a ruthless dictator who spends his time in the
of??ce setting up a shadow government to globalize America
after you leave, you can lie through your teeth and smile at the
takers all day long. They got you where you are anyway.
We will certainly keep you updated on this developing story.
