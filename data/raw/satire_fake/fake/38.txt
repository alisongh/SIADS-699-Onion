Hillary Clinton is still whining about her humiliating loss to President Donald Trump in last year’s election. She plans to take him down and her plan involves some powerful Republicans. Wikileaks named Paul Ryan, Carly Fiorina, John Kasich, Jeb Bush, Lindsey Graham, and John McCain as Republicans who were paid off by Clinton to ensure that Donald Trump lost the election, or undermine him if he won as reported by Conservative Daily Post. Her evil plot was revealed in an email sent last July from Clinton’s campaign manager John Podesta to top aide Huma Abedin. Podesta detailed how the funds were being redirected from Clinton’s campaign to the Super PACs of Carly Fiorina, John Kasich, and Jeb Bush. “JB, CF, and JK PACS will be noticeably silent for the rest of the campaign.” The email continued, “Each will receive a significant allowance from advertising budget. HRC is in the loop and has talked to all three personally. Eyes only.” As revealed in other emails, several members of the Republican Party were bought off in order to push the Clinton agenda forward. Only one day before Speaker of the House Paul Ryan retracted Donald Trump’s invitation to speak at an event in Wisconsin, an email was sent out that could be to blame. It read, “He is on board, will retract the invitation to speak. Eyes only.” Other Clinton emails imply that money is being moved to Republican elected officials in the House and Senate. For example, right after John McCain attacked President Trump by publicly criticizing him, FEC records show that two large donations from PACS and private sources went to the senator immediately after.
