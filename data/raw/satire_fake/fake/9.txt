VIA| Illegal immigrants do NOT have the same rights as American citizens. Illegal immigrants came here illegally and than collect welfare paid for by taxpayers money because Barack Obama didn’t seem to have a problem with it. President Trump doesn’t agree with this and has therefore signed an executive order stating no illegal will be eligible for welfare and any currently enrolled will be removed from the country. Via USA Politics Today: President Trump signed an executive order according to which any illegal who lives on welfare will be sent home. And that’s not all. America will no longer accept people who come here to live on our expense. These people will no longer be able to enter the country. “The administration would be seeking to “deny admission to any alien who is likely to become a public charge” and develop standards for “determining” whether an immigrant can be deported after five years, if that person receives a certain amount of public assistance, including Food Stamps, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and Medicaid.” Welfare was designed to help Americans, end of story.
