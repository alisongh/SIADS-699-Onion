It’s Over: 3 Richest Democrates Just Went On FOX Today And Give Trump Something Unfathomable

This is a very special day from President Trump. This morning Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and Charlie Munger went on FOX News and dropped the kind of bombshell the Left fears most. The 3 Richest Democrats just gave Trump full support of his job as President. The three mega-billionaires were asked to give their opinions on President Trump as well as “tips” for him. Warren Buffet said, “I would certainly say to him [Trump] the same thing I would say to any other president—that their most important job is to protect us from weapons of mass destruction and that they are the most important person in the world, to put the emphasis on that.” Charlie Munger then jumped in to add a very direct praise of the President, “I am a great admirer of the Trump change of mind about China and making an ally out of China instead of screaming about their trade.” Bill Gates decided to go a different route and offer the President his personal counsel. “Whether it’s research, making sure that pandemics don’t come to get us and helping other countries … I’d make sure he knew all about it.” It’s funny because Democrats LOVE pointing to these men as “geniuses” and using their quotes to back their point. Reality Check! Gates, Buffet, and Munger may not be on the Trump-Train just yet, but at least they are willing to praise the job he has done as President so far.
