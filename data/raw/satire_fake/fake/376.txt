CONSERVATIVE TRIBUNE
There are many conspiracy theories floating out there about President Barack Obama. Some claim he is a Muslim, a terrorist or a Russian spy. However, what is known beyond any reasonable doubt is that he is largely incompetent and has little love for America.
Proof of this can be found by looking no further that the White House logo, which was redesigned in 2016.
Everyone known what the White House logo is supposed to look like — a portrait of the North Face of the White House — but what few people have noticed over the past few years was the change at the top of the logo.
For many years, the White House logo had the American flag flying on the top of the White House — as it does in real life. In Obama’s redesigned version, there is no American flag, just a white flag.
Here is what the original logo looked like:

And here is Obama’s sanitized version:

The white flag is a common symbol for surrender, which has many people wondering if Obama was trying to secretly signal to America’s enemies that he was surrendering.
In all seriousness, this probably wasn’t some secret signal. It was just Obama disrespecting America and trying to get rid of anything that made us special — which really shouldn’t surprise anyone at this point.
Obama has disgraced the American flag multiple times while in office, so it should be no surprise that he would completely remove it from the White House logo.
We’ve suffered for almost eight years under a president who has made it clear he doesn’t think America is special. We desperately need to elect someone who will restore our faith in our country and put America, and Americans, first.
