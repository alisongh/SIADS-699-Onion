Pulitzer-prize winning reporter Seymour Hersh has revealed that the FBI have evidence that Seth Rich leaked the DNC emails to WikiLeaks. Hersh said in a recent phone interview that the FBIs cyber unit found conclusive evidence on Seth Rich’s computer that he had leaked DNC emails to WikiLeaks shorty before his untimely death: [The DC police took Seth Rich’s computer, but couldn’t get past his password.] So they call the FBI cyber unit. The Feds get through [the password-protection on Rich’s computer], and this is what they find. This is according to the FBI report. What the report says is that – some time in late spring or early summer – he [Rich] makes contact with WikiLeaks. That’s in his computer. They [the FBI] found what he [Rich] had done was he had submitted a series of documents – of emails, of juicy emails – from the DNC. By the way, all this shit about the DNC, where the hack, it wasn’t hacked … He [Rich] offered a sample, an extensive sample, I’m sure dozens of emails, and said I want money. [Remember, WikiLeaks often pays whistleblowers.] Later, WikiLeaks did get the password. He [Rich] had a dropbox, a protected dropbox, which isn’t hard to do. They got access to the dropbox. That’s in the FBI report. He also let people know with whom he was dealing … the word was passed, according to the FBI report, “I also shared this box with a couple of friends, so if anything happens to me, it’s not going to solve your problem”. But WikiLeaks got access, before he was killed. I have a narrative of how that whole fucking thing began.   It’s a [former CIA director John] Brennan operation. It was an American disinformation [campaign].
