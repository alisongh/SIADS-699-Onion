FEINSTEIN CONTINUES TO SERVICE THE COUNTRY
http://www.ini-world-report.org/2017/08/01/feinstein-continues-to-service-the-country/
“Truth or Fiction” confirms the story is true. “Snopes” confirms that it is true that Blum got the contract but not due to his wife’s influence. Of course not! (Duh!)
The US has entered into an exclusive contract with a real estate firm to sell 56 buildings that currently house U.S. Post Offices.
The sale of these properties will fetch about $19 billion.
A regular real estate commission will be paid to that company.
That company is CRI. CRI will be making a minimum of 3% and as much as 6% commission on each and every sale.
CRI belongs to a man named Richard Blum.  Richard Blum is the husband of Senator Dianne Feinstein.
Senator Feinstein and her husband stand to make a fortune from these transactions (EST at between $950 million and $1.1billion!).
How does a U.S. Senator from San Francisco manage to get away with organizing and lobbying such a sweet deal?
Has our government become so elitist that they have no fear of oversight?  Isn’t this a cousin to insider trading?
Pass this info on before it’s pulled from the Internet.

This is Ineptocracy, A system of government where the least
capable of leading are elected by the least capable of producing.
Where the members of society least likely to sustain themselvesare rewarded with goods and services confiscated from a diminishing number of citizens that are actually productive.
AND PELOSI AND HER HUSBAND MADE A MEGA FORTUNE TRADING ON INSIDE INFORMATION AND MARTHA STEWART WENT TO PRISON.
