golbeck-16,fake,Golbeck,"BOOM: PRESIDENT TRUMP SENT MICHELLE OBAMA A BILL SHE`LL NEVER BE ABLE TO PAY IN HER LIFETIME!!
Michelle Obama will go down in history as the First Lady who spent more money than any other. In addition to her 214 personal assistants, 32 gardeners, 11 dog walkers and her own mother on the government payroll as a “day care provider,” Moochelle also purchased $11 million worth of new furniture, an airplane, four yachts and two limousines with taxpayer money. What’s worse is that after she left, she decided she should be able to keep all of that stuff, even though technically it belongs to the American people. After an audit by the White House budget office, President Trump ordered that Michelle Obama be sent a bill for everything she should have paid for by herself but used government money instead. The bill, which totals eleventy billion dollars, is more than the Obama family will likely be able to afford in their lifetime. The tab includes $10 billion for vacations and the balance in food, clothing, liquor and cigarettes that should have been paid for out of their own pockets. The planes, boats and cars have been repossessed but they still have to pay for their use, wear and tear and fuel consumption. President Trump isn’t messing around, either. Press Secretary Sean Spicer’s assistant, Karen, told the Federalist: “PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL GARNISH THEIR PENSIONS, PUT LIENS ON THEIR PROPERTIES AND IF NECESSARY, STRIP THEM OF THEIR CITIZENSHIP AND SEND THEM BACK TO KENYA. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED THAT MONEY TO INVEST IN WHOLESOME PROJECTS LIKE THE NEW IVANKA TRUMP RETAIL STORES THAT WILL BRING 1200 JOBS TO AMERICA, LOWERING THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE TO 2.1 PERCENT. OBAMA NEVER HAD NUMBERS LIKE THAT.” Indeed he did not. Obama caused the worst unemployment crisis this country has ever seen, with more than 170 million people out of work at one time or another. The disgraceful spending by his wife could have been spent on training those people rather than just giving them all $62K a year in welfare benefits. That’s all over now. And Moochelle will pay.",BOOM PRESIDENT TRUMP SENT MICHELLE OBAMA A BILL SHELL NEVER BE ABLE TO PAY IN HER LIFETIME Michelle Obama go history First Lady spent money other In addition 214 personal assistants 32 gardeners 11 dog walkers mother government payroll day care provider Moochelle also purchased 11 million worth new furniture airplane four yachts two limousines taxpayer money Whats worse left decided able keep stuff even though technically belongs American people After audit White House budget office President Trump ordered Michelle Obama sent bill everything paid used government money instead The bill totals eleventy billion dollars Obama family likely able afford lifetime The tab includes 10 billion vacations balance food clothing liquor cigarettes paid pockets The planes boats cars repossessed still pay use wear tear fuel consumption President Trump isnt messing around either Press Secretary Sean Spicers assistant Karen told Federalist PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL GARNISH THEIR PENSIONS PUT LIENS ON THEIR PROPERTIES AND IF NECESSARY STRIP THEM OF THEIR CITIZENSHIP AND SEND THEM BACK TO KENYA THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED THAT MONEY TO INVEST IN WHOLESOME PROJECTS LIKE THE NEW IVANKA TRUMP RETAIL STORES THAT WILL BRING 1200 JOBS TO AMERICA LOWERING THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE TO 21 PERCENT OBAMA NEVER HAD NUMBERS LIKE THAT Indeed not Obama caused worst unemployment crisis country ever seen 170 million people work one time another The disgraceful spending wife could spent training people rather giving 62K year welfare benefits Thats now And Moochelle pay

HUD Director Dr. Ben Carson found a big economic pitfall by the Obama administration.  The mainstream media has neglected to report on a BIG find by Dr. Ben Carson. The Trump cabinet is a winning cabinet.  Dr. Carson dug into the agencies records in a sweeping audit wherein he found substantial bookkeeping errors, which only prove either the incompetence or the corrupt nature of the previous administration led by former-president, Barack Obama.  The HUD report found $500 billion in fraud and mismanagement in the government agency.  What We Found  The total amounts of errors corrected in HUDs notes and consolidated financial statements were $516.4 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. There were several other unresolved audit matters, which restricted our ability to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to express an opinion. These unresolved audit matters relate to (1) the Office of General Counsels refusal to sign the management representation letter, (2) HUDs improper use of cumulative and first-in, first-out budgetary accounting methods of disbursing community planning and development program funds, (3) the $4.2 billion in nonpooled loan assets from Ginnie Maes stand-alone financial statements that we could not audit due to inadequate support, (4) the improper accounting for certain HUD assets and liabilities, and (5) material differences between HUDs subledger and general ledger accounts. This audit report contains 11 material weaknesses, 7 significant deficiencies, and 5 instances of noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations.  We took a screenshot of the .pdf file that outlines the findings by Dr. Carson and his team:  So far the Trump administration has had opposition from the left and the mainstream media.

Loud-mouth liberal celebrity, Ashley Judd, sent Tweets saying America lacks behind some other countries in equal rights for women. Does she want to go live there then, because we can start a GoFundMe for her one-way ticket to Burundi, Serbia, or Iraq which apparently treat women better than America. Maybe she forgets about the Muslims who murder Christians in the Middle East. Maybe she wants some acid thrown in her face or a gay friend tossed off a 5 story building. All of those can be arranged with her trip when she moves out of America. Im sure they would love to have a C-List celebrity with no gratitude for the great American country she lives in as a millionaire.  Ashley Judds terrible Tweets were met with hilariously heavy criticism from the plethora of much smarter people on the Internet. You would think someone like Judd hasnt surpassed 7th grade by the amount of stupid things she says. As long as you made it halfway through seventh grade, then youre probably smarter than this twit.  Start packing your bags, ladies. All ten of them with the blow-dryers and 46 colors of nail polish. Get your giant vagina costume all stuffed into a carry-on, or better yet, wear it on your flight to Iraq. Lets see how fast youre on a flight back to America. No chance you ladies survive a day in another country. Youll be back to the USA faster than the next Womens March can hire another terrorist or murderer. Youll be back to America faster than Madonna can hand out sexual favors for Clinton votes -whats she owe, like 50 million favors? Any woman who leaves America because of a numeric ranking is absurd, but I will fully support you leaving the country and making room for more intelligent women to take over. Seriously, please, get out. Make room for people with logically working brains filled to the brim with common sense and lacking stupidity.  You tell us. You know everything. Read the darn Constitution for once and stop reminding everyone that youve gone full stupid. You know Twitter users DRILLED her for this.  Here are some of the great replies from Twitter.  Usually when the Constitution is read, then people actually know it. It covers all people. Its not sexually discriminating. God forbid someone who speaks in front of thousands of people actually knows what shes talking about. You can read about the Constitution on Wikipediaand become a genius in about 15 minutes.  Lest we forget the horrible speech she gave to the beta males and man-hating feminists at the Womens March, which was quite possibly the most embarrassing thing a large group of women has ever done. Id like to see a mens march and our version of the costumes. I wonder how long that would last before we were arrested thanks to some whiny feminists.

Hillary Clinton is still whining about her humiliating loss to President Donald Trump in last year’s election. She plans to take him down and her plan involves some powerful Republicans. Wikileaks named Paul Ryan, Carly Fiorina, John Kasich, Jeb Bush, Lindsey Graham, and John McCain as Republicans who were paid off by Clinton to ensure that Donald Trump lost the election, or undermine him if he won as reported by Conservative Daily Post. Her evil plot was revealed in an email sent last July from Clinton’s campaign manager John Podesta to top aide Huma Abedin. Podesta detailed how the funds were being redirected from Clinton’s campaign to the Super PACs of Carly Fiorina, John Kasich, and Jeb Bush. “JB, CF, and JK PACS will be noticeably silent for the rest of the campaign.” The email continued, “Each will receive a significant allowance from advertising budget. HRC is in the loop and has talked to all three personally. Eyes only.” As revealed in other emails, several members of the Republican Party were bought off in order to push the Clinton agenda forward. Only one day before Speaker of the House Paul Ryan retracted Donald Trump’s invitation to speak at an event in Wisconsin, an email was sent out that could be to blame. It read, “He is on board, will retract the invitation to speak. Eyes only.” Other Clinton emails imply that money is being moved to Republican elected officials in the House and Senate. For example, right after John McCain attacked President Trump by publicly criticizing him, FEC records show that two large donations from PACS and private sources went to the senator immediately after.",Wikileaks Massive Exposure Here Are 6 Republicans Who Took Bribes From Clinton To Destroy Trump Hillary Clinton still whining humiliating loss President Donald Trump last years election She plans take plan involves powerful Republicans Wikileaks named Paul Ryan Carly Fiorina John Kasich Jeb Bush Lindsey Graham John McCain Republicans paid Clinton ensure Donald Trump lost election undermine reported Conservative Daily Post Her evil plot revealed email sent last July Clintons campaign manager John Podesta top aide Huma Abedin Podesta detailed funds redirected Clintons campaign Super PACs Carly Fiorina John Kasich Jeb Bush JB CF JK PACS noticeably silent rest campaign The email continued Each receive significant allowance advertising budget HRC loop talked three personally Eyes only As revealed emails several members Republican Party bought order push Clinton agenda forward Only one day Speaker House Paul Ryan retracted Donald Trumps invitation speak event Wisconsin email sent could blame It read He board retract invitation speak Eyes only Other Clinton emails imply money moved Republican elected officials House Senate For example right John McCain attacked President Trump publicly criticizing him FEC records show two large donations PACS private sources went senator immediately after

According to the city’s police departmnent, many clues collected on the site suggest that he might have been the victim of an elaborate murder plot. “The police forces have only been able to proceed to preliminary analysis before we spotted a source of radiations on the scene and had to call a decontamination team” explains Sven Munger of the Zurich Police Department.”We can confirm that the radioactive agent is a very rare russian product named TCDD Dioxin. The clues we have collected are insufficient to pronounce a definitive conclusion, but the complexity of the of plot we have exposed greatly reduces the number of suspects.” The victim had attracted a lot of attention from the Russian government and media in 2011 when he had written a book entitled “Я был любовник Путина” (“I was Putin’s Lover“), which was taken off the shelves before the official release, after a presidential decree. A warrant demanding the arrest of the author was also issued across Russia, leading him to file a demand of political asylum from the helvetic state.
