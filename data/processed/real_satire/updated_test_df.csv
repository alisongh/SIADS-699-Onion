"the cleveland cavaliers took the latter approach this summer . they focused on bolstering a bench that ranked dead last in the nba in scoring last season at 23 . 8 points per game , rather than simply being satisfied with being a top heavy team that came awful close to winning a championship with little depth . and , man , did it ever show in the cavs ' 106 76 win over the memphis grizzlies on wednesday . cleveland ' s bench outscored the grizzlies ' reserves 50 29 , fueling the rout . it came a night after the cavs ' bench scored just 20 points in their season opening loss to chicago , but even in that game , cleveland ' s second unit was instrumental in helping to chip away at the bulls ' early double digit lead that they established against the cavs ' starters . i think that might be a record for us , at least in my time here 50 points off the bench , blatt said . they were terrific . terrific . richard jefferson had 14 points as the cleveland bench scored 50 against the grizzlies . ? that might be an understatement considering that so far two of cleveland ' s players that will be relied upon as substitutes this season , mo williams and j . r . smith , have been filling in as starters for the injured kyrie irving and iman shumpert . coach is going to have some problems on his hands , good problems to have , especially when shump and ky come back , said lebron james , whose scoring total of 12 points against the grizzlies was matched or exceeded by three bench guys , richard jefferson , matthew dellavedova and jared cunningham . we ' ve got 12 guys , if you look at it , that ' s played meaningful basketball for our team . and then you add the two guys in mo and rj , we have so much depth that no one has to play big minutes if need be . coach can decide what he wants to do and be confident in everyone who ' s on the floor . minutes are always a big topic of discussion when it comes to this point in james ' career . even though he ended up playing a career low 36 . 1 minutes per game last season , some of his scheduled breaks were cut short when he felt compelled to check back in the game because the cavs ' understudies failed to protect a lead without him out there . we were talking about it on the bench today , smith said . this is the first time we ' ve got somebody who can come in and actually give bron a rest when he needs to instead of him coming in the game because we ' re losing the lead or something like that . that somebody is jefferson . no spring chicken himself either at 35 years old , he scored 24 points through the first two games , making nine of the 13 shots he has taken . right now james does so many things , so when i get the opportunity to give him a break i just try to keep up the defensive intensity , jefferson said . obviously i stretch the floor a little bit and help everyone out . blatt stuck to a strict eight man rotation for most of the second half of last season when the cavs made their run . it came back to bite them in the playoffs when irving and kevin love went down and cleveland was left with few replacement options because the players at the end of blatt ' s bench had been collecting dust for months . jefferson was asked if blatt made him any promises while recruiting him to the cavs , to let him know that he wouldn ' t end up like mike miller , shawn marion and kendrick perkins did last season accomplished veterans like jefferson , who sacrificed to come to cleveland and ended up cut out of the rotation . no , no , no , jefferson said . nothing is assured in this league , ever . my job is to come here and try to earn every minute i get , earn every shot , earn every time in the rotation . nothing is guaranteed . that ' s the mentality everyone has to come and i think everyone

"and if it ever becomes a reality , it could make high speed train travel from the uk to the us a reality . the idea for the transport system of the future , was proposed in a competition run by think tank in a bid to boost business between manchester and new york . the future ? a concept for a transatlantic train in a vacuum tunnel ( illustrated ) dubbed the ' concorde of the tunnelling world , ' has been proposed in a competition the proposal , which was seen by ippr north , claims that technological advantages could make the dream of a transatlantic train journey a reality and transform the economy in the north of england . the train would be contained within a tube underneath the atlantic ocean , with a service running in a perfect vacuum . ' the train is levitated in mid air using electric magnets , ' said simon horton , a young professional who submitted the idea with several colleagues . the proposal claims that a transatlantic train journey would transform the economy in the north of england , together with the region ' s own ' hyperloop ' ( pictured ) which would connect city airports ' this reduces nearly all causes of friction and drag , enabling both huge speeds and a completely smooth ( and silent ) journey . ' based on calculations by entrepreneur elon musk , who came up with the idea of a train that travels inside a vacuum tube , a journey between manchester and new york city could take just four hours , if a maximum speed of 800mph ( 1 , 287kph ) was achievable . paul batty , another competition entrant under the age of 25 , proposed a ' northern hyperloop , ' which has much in common with elon musk ' s designs for a hyperloop vacuum train , only instead of connecting los angeles and san francisco , the northern english version would link airports to a ' superhub ' . inside the tubes of elon musk ' s design , hyperloop , pods are mounted on thin skis made out of inconel , an alloy already used by his spacex firm that can withstand high pressure and heat . air is pumped into the skis via small holes to make an air cushion , and each pod has air inlets at the front . an electric turbo compressor compresses air from the nose and routes it to the skis and to the cabin . magnets on the skis , plus an electromagnetic pulse give the pod its initial thrust reboosting motors along the route would keep the pod moving at just below the speed of sound so the system does not produce sonic booms . under the plans , individual airports would act as terminals within a single rapidly connected local , national and international rail and air network . the english design also builds on mr musk ' s vacuum tunnel concept by adding a propeller to the front of the train to force any remaining air resistance back . cities such as manchester could also see other futuristic changes to their transport systems . sections of the road could be replaced by solar panels to generate power for the national grid , according to a group of students , or electricity could be generated by energy capturing technology to convert noise energy to electricity intended to power electric cars , for example . in another futuristic vision , the region ' s roads would be equipped with wind capturing technology , which would convert wind energy to electricity , made available to electric car drivers via vehicles charging points . the transport system would reap benefits including a reduced reliance on fossil fuels and greater availability of renewable energy , the think tank said . under the plans , individual airports would act as terminals within a single rapidly connected local , national and international rail and air network . a train could run from manchester ( pictured left ) to new york ( right ) the design has much in common with elon musk ' s plans for a vacuum train called the hyperloop ( illustrated ) , only instead of connecting los angeles and san francisco , the northern english version would link airports to a ' superhub ' a 15 year plan called one north , submitted on behalf of the cities of liverpool , manchester , leeds , newcastle and sheffield already features an interconnected transport system across air , roads , ports and rail , including the high speed east west rail route dubbed hs3 . it also includes a potential new tunnel through the pennines to increase rail capacity . environmentally friendly developments feature heavily in future plans with ideas for ' green cities ' , a carbon free north and even the creation of a pennines national park . the park would span the lake district and yorkshire dales national parks to include the pennines range , attracting tourism and jobs by playing on the heightened ' status ' . it is the brainchild of professor ian wray , who believes parts of the moors should be considered potential world heritage sites arguing they are ' particularly rich in industrial archaeology ' . ' some of these moors were the birthplace of a system of "" proto industrialism "" which lit the fuse for the industrial revolution in manchester and yorkshire , ' he said . the proposal , which was seen by ippr north , claims that technological advantages could make the dream of a transatlantic train journey a reality , between manchester and new york ( both marked on the map ) one day , sections of road could be replaced by solar panels ( illustrated with a concept image ) to generate power for the national grid , or electricity could be generated by energy capturing technology to convert noise energy to electricity intended to power electric cars , for example billionaire inventor elon musk has revealed he plans to build a test track for hyperloop a futuristic type of transport that would shoot capsules of passengers along a tube at around the speed of sound . mr musk claims his solar powered ' hyperloop ' could herald a revolution in travel and is building the test facility to prove it . he believes it would take just 30 minutes to travel the 381 miles ( 613km ) from los angeles to san francisco half the time it takes in a plane and likened the passenger experience to disneyland ' s rocket ride space mountain . elon musk ' s hyperloop ( an conceptual image is shown ) could take just 30 minutes to travel the 381 miles ( 613 km ) from los angeles to san francisco half the time it takes in a plane . he has likened the passenger experience to disneyland ' s rocket ride space mountain now , the plans are beginning to take shape . mr musk tweeted : ' will be building a hyperloop test track for companies and student teams to test out their pods . most likely in texas . ' a new firm , hyperloop transportation technologies , is developing plans to makes the tubes a reality and it has recruited experts from around the world . the crowdsourced firm has around 100 engineers on the projects , and nearly all of them have day jobs at companies like boeing , nasa , yahoo ! , airbus , spacex , and salesforce . mr musk ' s idea is based on the pneumatic tubes that fire capsules of paperwork between floors in offices . in this case , the capsules would carry people even cars in low pressure tubes to minimise turbulence and maximise speed . on top of pylons is a hovering capsule inside a low pressurized tube , which can reach speeds of up to 760 mph . ' the only resistance would be the air in front of the capsule , which we moved to the back by using a compressor , ' hyperloop ceo dirk ahlborn said . at its launch , musk described the hyperloop design as looking like a shotgun , with the tubes running side by side for most of the journey , then closing at either end to form a loop . trains of capsules would shoot through the almost air free tube at up to 760mph ( 1 , 223kph ) , accelerated by magnets which would also keep each pod on a steady course . each capsule would float on a cushion of air it creates as it speeds along similar to an air hockey table . while trains travelling through vacuum tubes could one day connect major us cities ( illustrated ) , for now , a test track will be uilt to test the idea most likely in texas , according to a tweet capsules carrying six to eight people would depart every 30 seconds , with tickets costing around 13 ( 20 ) each way . in his proposal released online , musk wrote : ' short of figuring out real teleportation , which would of course be awesome ( someone please do this ) , the only option for super fast travel is to build a tube over or under the ground that contains a special environment . ' the proposed route of the first hyperloop follows interstate 5 , which runs through the agriculture rich central valley in california . it would take seven to ten years to build . musk put the price tag at around 4billion ( 2 . 6billion ) .",1,ever becomes reality  could make high speed train travel uk us reality  idea transport system future  proposed competition run think tank bid boost

"this after the government of el salvador urging women to avoid getting pregnant until 2018 . the virus has affected thousands of babies in brazil , causing the number of newborns born with microcephaly ? a birth defect which causes babies to have unusually small heads and abnormal brain development ? to skyrocket . federal health officials added the united states virgin islands and the dominican republic to a list of countries where pregnant women , or women trying to get pregnant , should avoid traveling to . at present there are 24 countries on the center for disease control and prevention s list of countries with active virus transmission ? 22 of these are located in the americas . here are the vital questions revolving around the mosquito borne virus you need to focus on : what is zika , and am i at risk ? zika is a mosquito borne virus related to yellow fever , west nile , and dengue fever . mosquitos from the aedes species ? commonly found in hotter parts of the country like florida and hawaii ? carry the virus . the tiger mosquito , which can be found in new york during the summertime , does too . in the second half of 2015 , authorities recorded over 3 , 000 cases of microcephaly in infants in brazil . cases of the zika virus have been previously reported in africa , the pacific islands , and southeast asia , but the first confirmed case in the western hemisphere was reported in may 2015 . anybody who travels to a country , or lives in the a country , where the virus is found is at risk for infection , according to the cdc . the three new yorkers who tested positive for the virus contracted it abroad ? one has fully recovered , and the other two are expected to recover without complication . there is virtually no risk of acquiring zika virus in new york state at this time , the department of health commissioner howard zucker said saturday . "" the virus cannot be spread by casual contact with an infected person and mosquitoes are not active in cold winter months , he said . mosquitos from the aedes species , commonly found in florida and hawaii , carry the virus . approximately one in five people infected with the zika virus will develop symptoms ? which include high fever , joint and muscle aches , rash , conjunctivitis , and headaches , according to the cdc . until recently , symptoms of the virus were considerably mild , so it was not considered a major threat . the brazilian babies with deformed heads , whose photos have dominated headlines in recent weeks , are suffering from microcephaly as an indirect result of the zika virus . for perspective : previously , 1 2 cases of microcephaly were recorded for every 10 , 000 births . during the second half of 2015 , 3 , 000 suspected cases were recorded ? that ' s 20 cases in 10 , 000 . researchers are still studying the link between zika and microcephaly . in the meantime , they have warned pregnant women or women trying to get pregnant to avoid traveling to affected areas . another possible indirect consequence of the zika virus is developing the guillain barre syndrome . gbs is a disorder where a person s immune system causes harm to its nerve cells ? resulting in muscle weakness and potentially paralysis , according to the cdc . a full recovery is expected in most cases though some deaths have been reported . an uptick in diagnoses of gbs in brazil , which correlate with the outbreak of the zika virus , has caused the cdc to investigate whether a relationship exists between the two . the cdc released this algorithm for pregnant women that have had a history of travel to areas exposed to the zika virus . there is currently no vaccine or medication available for zika sufferers . the cdc have advised those affected to keep well hydrated , get plenty of rest and to use acetaminophen or paracetamol as a pain reliever ? not aspirin or non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs , which should be avoided until the dengue virus has been ruled out . if you have contracted the zika virus , avoid mosquitos in the first week of illness . infecting previously uninfected mosquitoes could potentially pass the virus onto others .",1,government el salvador urging women avoid getting pregnant 2018  virus affected thousands babies brazil  causing number newborns born microcephaly  birth defect causes babies unusually small heads abnormal brain development  skyrocket  federal health officials added united states virgin islands dominican republic list countries pregnant women  women trying get pregnant  avoid traveling  present 24 countries center disease control prevention list countries active virus transmission  22 located americas  vital questions revolving around mosquito borne virus need focus  zika  risk  zika mosquito borne virus related yellow fever  west nile  dengue fever  mosquitos aedes species  commonly found hotter parts country like florida hawaii  carry virus  tiger mosquito  found new york summertime   second half 2015  authorities recorded 3  000 cases microcephaly infants brazil  cases zika virus previously reported africa  pacific islands  southeast asia  first confirmed case western hemisphere reported may 2015  anybody travels country  lives country  virus found risk infection  according cdc  three new yorkers tested positive virus contracted abroad  one fully recovered  two expected recover without complication  virtually risk acquiring zika virus new york state time  department health commissioner howard zucker said saturday   virus cannot spread casual contact infected person mosquitoes active cold winter months  said  mosquitos aedes species  commonly found florida hawaii  carry virus  approximately one five people infected zika virus develop symptoms  include high fever  joint muscle aches  rash  conjunctivitis  headaches  according cdc  recently  symptoms virus considerably mild  considered major threat  brazilian babies deformed heads  whose photos dominated headlines recent weeks  suffering microcephaly indirect result zika virus  perspective  previously  1 2 cases microcephaly recorded every 10  000 births  second half 2015  3  000 suspected cases recorded   20 cases 10  000  researchers still studying link zika microcephaly  meantime  warned pregnant women women trying get pregnant avoid traveling affected areas  another possible indirect consequence zika virus developing guillain barre syndrome  gbs disorder person immune system causes harm nerve cells  resulting muscle weakness potentially paralysis  according cdc  full recovery expected cases though deaths reported  uptick diagnoses gbs brazil  correlate outbreak zika virus  caused cdc investigate whether relationship exists two  cdc released algorithm pregnant women history travel areas exposed zika virus  currently vaccine medication available zika sufferers  cdc advised affected keep well hydrated  get plenty rest use acetaminophen paracetamol pain reliever  aspirin non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs  avoided dengue virus ruled  contracted zika virus  avoid mosquitos first week illness  infecting previously uninfected mosquitoes could potentially pass virus onto others ,programming

"in a rare case , german foreign intelligence bnd warns that saudi arabia , one of the west s closest allies , is tempted to play a destabilizing role in the middle east , pursuing its "" increasingly aggressive foreign policy . "" germany s federal security service ( bnd ) has issued a policy paper that outlines the immediate risks coming from saudi arabia s strong desire to become a dominant power in the middle east , according to der spiegel ' s story . the memo widely quoted by the germany s top newspapers says the increasingly offensive foreign policy has come in since the new saudi king , salman bin abdulaziz , was crowned in january 2015 . it reportedly says internal power struggles in the royal family and the ambition to unilaterally rule the whole region threaten to make the key western ally a frequent source of instability in the arab world . the current cautious diplomatic posture of senior members of the saudi royal family will be replaced by an impulsive interventionist policy , the bnd memo was quoted by der spiegel as saying . black friday saudi style : riyadh to behead more than 50 people within saudi ruling circles , the bnd singles out the king s son , deputy crown prince and defense minister mohammad bin salman al saud as among those who are pushing for a new , far more aggressive and dangerous course , which explains the emerging threats coming from the new saudi arabian regime . prince mohammad bin salman is believed to play a central role in saudi arabia s move to invade neighboring yemen , but he has also seized control over the kingdom s economic assets , bnd says . the concentration of so much power in his hands harbors a latent risk that in pursuit for establishing himself in the line of succession in his father s lifetime , he may overreach , der spiegel quotes the memo as saying . if that happens , relations with friendly and above all allied countries in the middle east could be more than worsened , while the us influence over the region will be neglected , the memo says . both the ruling king salman and his son , prince mohammad , are desperate to become dominant rulers of the arab world through building up a strong military component and new regional alliances , german intelligence agency s memo reads . mohammad , aged 30 , is also described by bnd as being keen to seize the throne after his father s passing , though he is only second in the succession line behind the king s nephew , 80 year old crown prince mohammed bin nayef . if that becomes a reality , the bnd analysts write , the whole region would also face constant unrest because of a mounting rivalry with iran . strategic struggle between the two countries based on religious and ideological hostility is likely to unleash conflicts across neighboring iraq , lebanon and bahrain , with riyadh not fearing to take serious military , financial and political risks , the memo warns . in syria , it is a top priority for saudi arabia s new royal family to make president bashar assad

"fertility clinics across the country are struggling to recruit enough local men as the demand now from single women and same sex couples is too much . the number of people accessing donor insemination has also more than tripled in the past four years . another major effect is that donating sperm anonymously has been banned state wide , and this has put many men off from donating sperm in recent years . culturally australians lag behind most other countries when it comes to donating tissues or organs anyway . so there was never that many available sperm donors to begin with . a big increase in demand for donor sperm has seen fertility clinics looking further afield ' there is a serious shortage in donor sperm , ' associate professor peter illingworth , medical director at ivf australia , said . ' the demand is such from the likes of single women and same sex couples that overseas donations is definitely one way of meeting this shortfall . ' so long as the same practices that are required in australia are followed overseas it will work . but other countries need to comply fully with all the ethical and legal standards set out in australia . ' it is essential that full identification of each sperm donors is provided . in the past anonymity had persuaded men to donate sperm , but this is now a thing of the past . associate professor peter illingworth advocates the full identification of each sperm donor ' it is very important that the donors are willing to leave their identity for the children when they get older . as a consequence of that we don ' t have as many donors as we need , ' prof illingworth said . ' the actual legislation varies a little bit from one state to another . ' but it is the case that in every state in australia , donors do need to leave their identity , and nowhere in australia is there totally anonymous sperm donations any more . ' if the same practices that are required in australia are followed overseas there should be no issues prof illingworth said there were still many men who want to give their sperm so others can have a family , and to leave a bit of themselves behind on the planet , but nowhere near as many as before . ' there ' s a general acceptance that the old days of using anonymous sperm donors was not a good thing , and that there are a number of young adults who have been quite severely traumatised by the fact they can ' t track down where they have come from , ' prof illingworth explained . what also affects the number of sperm donors productivity is that from state to state it varies as to how many families a donor can create . in new south wales you are only allowed to use a donor to create five families , while in queensland and victoria it ' s 10 families . because of the increased demand from couples , clinics now are looking at a range of options however , dr chris copeland , the scientific director of the canberra fertility centre , believed that the main difference was that the likes of the united states and other countries were more prepared to donate their tissues in the first place . ' the anonymity factor has hurt us to an extent , but the number of sperm donors was never great to start with , ' dr copeland said . ' australians are notoriously poor tissue donors . we are one of the worst blood donor groups in the world for example . if you look at a propensity to donate australia is right down at the bottom of the list . ' it ' s a cultural thing . people in the us and europe are more likely to donate their blood or their organs . it ' s hardly surprising therefore that they ' re more willing to donate their sperm . ' we just have to try and encourage people here to be more generous . ' in their annual report the victorian assisted reproductive treatment authority said the number of donors whose sperm was available on july 1 dropped by 23 per cent compared to the previous year . increased communication internationally means the best sperm donors can be found ' the number of men signing up to become sperm donors has dwindled from 64 to 61 , because the demand has been so great . the number the number of women using donor insemination increased from 92 in 2009 10 to 311 this year , ' explained varta chief executive , louise johnson . ' some clinics in victoria have been investigating importing donor sperm . the important thing is that regardless of where the donors come from they still need to be identifiable , altruistic , and their details need to be accessible to the who are children born who will want to know this information . ' all the requirements under victorian legislation need to be meet concerning overseas donors . ' varta chief executive , louise johnson , believes all appropriate criteria must be met by overseas donors johnson said that because of the increased demand clinics are looking at a range of options . ' victorian clinics are still looking to expand their recruitment methods locally but checking overseas options as well . but they must be aware of the implications of donating and meet our criteria , ' she said . sourcing the appropriate sperm donors overseas is getting easier though . ' with increased communication internationally it ' s less of a hurdle to find the right sperm donor overseas . people are using skype to discuss possible donation . counsellors here use skype as a method of communicating with donors as well , ' johnson said . the rise in same sex couples wanting a child has forced some to look abroad for sperm donors the age reported that melbourne ivf is currently recruiting donors through a sperm bank in virginia in the united states in the hope that australian patients will have access to imported donor sperm by mid 2015 . ' the issue in victoria has been the legislation , which allows identification as a right to the offspring when they turn 18 , so what we ' ve discussed with a group in america is for them to recruit sperm donors who are happy to meet those requirements , ' medical director dr lyndon hale said . culturally australians are adverse to donating blood or organs . the same goes for sperm melbourne ivf saw the biggest decline in donor sperm supply last year . the number of new donors recruited increased from 42 to 44 in 12 months , but available donor sperm plummeted from 104 to eight over the same period .",1,fertility clinics across country struggling recruit enough local men demand single women sex couples much  number people accessing donor insemination also tripled past four years  another major effect donating sperm anonymously banned state wide  put many men donating sperm recent years  culturally australians lag behind countries comes donating tissues organs anyway  never many available sperm donors begin  big increase demand donor sperm seen fertility clinics looking afield  serious shortage donor sperm   associate professor peter illingworth  medical director ivf australia  said   demand likes single women sex couples overseas donations definitely one way meeting shortfall   long practices required australia followed overseas work  countries need comply fully ethical legal standards set australia   essential full identification sperm donors provided  past anonymity persuaded men donate sperm  thing past  associate professor peter illingworth advocates full identification sperm donor  important donors willing leave identity children get older  consequence  many donors need   prof illingworth said   actual legislation varies little bit one state another   case every state australia  donors need leave identity  nowhere australia totally anonymous sperm donations   practices required australia followed overseas issues prof illingworth said still many men want give sperm others family  leave bit behind planet  nowhere near many    general acceptance old days using anonymous sperm donors good thing  number young adults quite severely traumatised fact  track come   prof illingworth explained  also affects number sperm donors productivity state state varies many families donor create  new south wales allowed use donor create five families  queensland victoria  10 families  increased demand couples  clinics looking range options however  dr chris copeland  scientific director canberra fertility centre  believed main difference likes united states countries prepared donate tissues first place   anonymity factor hurt us extent  number sperm donors never great start   dr copeland said   australians notoriously poor tissue donors  one worst blood donor groups world example  look propensity donate australia right bottom list    cultural thing  people us europe likely donate blood organs   hardly surprising therefore  willing donate sperm   try encourage people generous   annual report victorian assisted reproductive treatment authority said number donors whose sperm available july 1 dropped 23 per cent compared previous year  increased communication internationally means best sperm donors found  number men signing become sperm donors dwindled 64 61  demand great  number number women using donor insemination increased 92 2009 10 311 year   explained varta chief executive  louise johnson   clinics victoria investigating importing donor sperm  important thing regardless donors come still need identifiable  altruistic  details need accessible children born want know information   requirements victorian legislation need meet concerning overseas donors   varta chief executive  louise johnson  believes appropriate criteria must met overseas donors johnson said increased demand clinics looking range options   victorian clinics still looking expand recruitment methods locally checking overseas options well  must aware implications donating meet criteria   said  sourcing appropriate sperm donors overseas getting easier though   increased communication internationally  less hurdle find right sperm donor overseas  people using skype discuss possible donation  counsellors use skype method communicating donors well   johnson said  rise sex couples wanting child forced look abroad sperm donors age reported melbourne ivf currently recruiting donors sperm bank virginia united states hope australian patients access imported donor sperm mid 2015   issue victoria legislation  allows identification right offspring turn 18   discussed group america recruit sperm donors happy meet requirements   medical director dr lyndon hale said  culturally australians adverse donating blood organs  goes sperm melbourne ivf saw biggest decline donor sperm supply last year  number new donors recruited increased 42 44 12 months  available donor sperm plummeted 104 eight period ,business

"" i cannot play third after men ' s and girls when my possible opponent plays second after girls , "" nadal , who lost the first set of his opener to daniel brands , said . "" that ' s not fair . and today i was playing almost three hours on court , and my opponent was watching the tv in the locker room .

"south carolina governor nikki haley speaks at the 2016 kemp forum on expanding opportunity in columbia , south carolina , january 9 , 2016 . the republican response to the president obama ' s state of the union address tuesday evening appears to rebut both president obama and some of the policies espoused by republican presidential candidate donald trump , according to excerpts released by house speaker paul ryan , r wisconsin . south carolina gov . nikki haley will deliver the official gop response after mr obama ' s speech . she is the first female and first minority governor of south carolina and the youngest governor in the country . she was first elected governor in 2010 and reelected in 2014 . how to watch president obama ' s final state of the union haley will argue that the president ' s record has "" fallen far short of his soaring words , "" according to the excerpts . but she will also recall her heritage as the daughter of indian immigrants , and call on americans to "" resist the temptation "" to follow the angriest voices in politics . "" no one who is willing to work hard , abide by our laws , and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country , "" she will say . the line reads like a response to trump ' s call for a temporary ban on all muslims entering the us in the wake of the shooting in san bernardino , california . here are the advance excerpts of haley ' s speech : "" the president ' s record has often fallen far short of his soaring words . as he enters his final year in office , many americans are still feeling the squeeze of an economy too weak to raise income levels . we ' re feeling a crushing national debt , a health care plan that has made insurance less affordable and doctors less available , and chaotic unrest in many of our cities . even worse , we are facing the most dangerous terrorist threat our nation has seen since september 11th , and this president appears either unwilling or unable to deal with it . soon , the obama presidency will end , and america will have the chance to turn in a new direction . that direction is what i want to talk about tonight . "" "" i am the proud daughter of indian immigrants who reminded my brothers , my sister and me every day how blessed we were to live in this country . . . my story is really not much different from millions of other americans . immigrants have been coming to our shores for generations to live the dream that is america . . . today , we live in a time of threats like few others in recent memory . during anxious times , it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices . we must resist that temptation . no one who is willing to work hard , abide by our laws , and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country . "" "" if we held the white house , taxes would be lower for working families , and we ' d put the brakes on runaway spending and debt . . . we would make international agreements that were celebrated in israel and protested in iran , not the other way around . and rather than just thanking our brave men and women in uniform , we would actually strengthen our military , so both our friends and our enemies would know that america seeks peace , but when we fight wars we win them . "" "" we have big decisions to make . our country is being tested . but we ' ve been tested in the past , and our people have always risen to the challenge . we have all the guidance we need to be safe and successful . our forefathers paved the way for us . let ' s take their values , and their strengths , and rededicate ourselves to doing whatever it takes to keep america the greatest country in the history of man .

"q : we recently bought five tickets for a family vacation in tanzania through cheapoair . com , an online travel agency . a few months later , we found out our daughter would be starting a new job and couldn ' t make the trip with us . so we phoned cheapoair to cancel our reservation . when we booked the tickets , a cheapoair representative told us the tickets were nonrefundable and that if we canceled and used our credit to rebook another flight , we would have to pay a penalty . but i was never told how much the penalty would be . cheapoair consulted with northwest airlines , which agreed to a full refund of all five tickets , which had cost us 2 , 271 each . cheapoair then charged us 535 per ticket in cancellation fees . i asked the agency for a breakdown , and it said the fees represented 410 to northwest , 75 to the consolidator and 50 to cheapoair . a cheapoair representative said that when you buy this type of fare and have to cancel , the penalty fees are enormous because the airlines want to recoup their lost revenue . we have accepted our responsibility in the cancellation , but think 535 per ticket is excessive . can you help ? marianne ellis , sacramento , california a : this could have turned out much worse . your airline could have pocketed all of your money , and you would have been out of luck . cheapoair sells what are known as "" consolidator "" fares that are often less expensive than the tickets you buy through a traditional travel agent or by booking directly . the reason ? it works through a ticket wholesaler that buys tickets in bulk at a big discount . then it marks up the ticket prices enough to make a profit while still undercutting other published fares . but that ' s not all . consolidator tickets typically come with more restrictions than the garden variety nonrefundable tickets sold by airlines . while some can be canceled and re used for a future purchase after paying a change fee , others are completely nonrefundable and non changeable . meaning that if you have second thoughts about your vacation , your ticket ' s gone . i don ' t understand why you wouldn ' t ask your online travel agent for details on the change fees particularly if your daughter is either contemplating a new job or looking for work . if there ' s even a chance you ' ll have to cancel your ticket , a consolidator fare isn ' t the way to go . you should have considered a ticket with more reasonable change fees ( although "" reasonable "" is relative northwest charged a 150 fee for international reservations at the time you bought your tickets , which is excessive to a lot of people ) . i also think the cheapoair representative with whom you spoke should have warned you about the change fees before you bought the tickets . this might have also been avoided by booking the tickets online , where such terms would presumably be clearly disclosed , instead of calling cheapoair . but not necessarily . i ' ve seen more than my share of confusing booking screens where important details are buried three screens under a hundred offers to rent a car or reserve a hotel room . i wouldn ' t have phoned the online agency after being asked to pay these cancellation fees . instead , a quick e mail to feedback cheapoair . com may have yielded better results . trust me on this : don ' t call e mail . i agree that 535 in cancellation charges is a little rich , so i contacted cheapoair on your behalf . i heard back from sneharthi roy , the company ' s senior vice president of operations , who verified that this was a consolidator fare and that the fees were in line with what the company charges . still , cheapoair asked its consolidator to waive the fees on your behalf . and it did . you ' ve received a full

"this piece of computer code tells the worm to activate on april 1 , researchers found . "" i think joke ' s on us a little bit , which you would have expected with having an april 1 date , "" said holly stewart , threat response manager for ibm ' s x force , a computer security service . "" by no means do i think we ' re in the clear , "" said paul henry , a forensics and security analyst for lumension security , based in phoenix , arizona . on wednesday , a master computer gained control of an estimated 5 million "" zombie "" pcs infected with the worm , experts said . security experts fear the author of the malicious computer program essentially could do anything with those windows based machines . no attempts by the author to upload anything had been noted as of 8 p . m . et wednesday , according to phil porras , program director at nonprofit research institute sri international . conficker ' s motive is probably financial , security experts said . the worm ' s author could steal financial information , shut down web pages , track keystrokes or send spam from infected computers . "" they have full administrative level rights to run anything they want on all of the infected machines , "" said mikko hypponen , chief research officer for f secure , an internet security company . experts urged computer users not to panic . the easiest way for computer users to see if they ' re infected is to try to access windows updates from microsoft . com . if you can reach the site and if your system updates are working , it is unlikely your computer is infected , experts said . further computer patches and information can be found at the conficker working group ' s web site . the worm does not affect mac computers . a core group of about 40 computer analysts , researchers and policy experts is working to dismantle the worm , said jose nazario , manager of security research at arbor networks , and a member of the group , which some call the conficker cabal . nazario said the group ' s unprecedented efforts may be one reason an attack hasn ' t happened . he said the april 1 launch date for the virus may have been a ploy by the program ' s author to get attention from the news media . or it could be a twisted joke . "" either way , it suggests an interesting sense of humor , i guess , "" he said . the worm allows a master computer to communicate with the infected machines through web sites the worm generates . that function became active april 1 , experts said , and allows conficker ' s author or authors to seize control of millions of computers around the world . infected machines are generating 50 , 000 urls per day , which allows the master to talk with them . a previous version of conficker created only 250 domain names per day . "" what happened now , today , is that the machines started pulling 50 , 000 domain names in 116 countries around the world so that ' s the change , "" said hypponen , another member of the conficker cabal . "" the conficker gang realized we could shut down 250 domain names a day , so they upped the ante , "" he said . computer experts will continue to try to shut down the web addresses that let conficker ' s author communicate with infected machines , he said . members of the conficker working group have contacted security officials in all 116 affected countries and have shut down many active domain names , hypponen said . stewart , of ibm , said the sophistication of the worm is unprecedented . the situation has played out in the news media as an april fools ' day joke . on a technology blog , the washington post mocked the hype about conficker . "" londoners woke up to find the iconic clock tower big ben stopped at precisely one minute till midnight , "" brian krebs wrote . "" the british tabloids blared that the giant timepiece had been felled by the conficker worm . "" the post ends with this statement : "" in case you haven ' t guessed it yet , april fools ! ! ! "" some have compared the situation to new year ' s day in 2000 , when many feared the world ' s computers would crash but few problems were seen . henry said that comparison doesn ' t fit . "" y2k was a one time event , "" he said . "" the update for conficker has basically prepped it for its future . it now has the ability to gather marching orders in a way that , to date , we haven ' t found a way to block . "" little is know about conficker ' s author . a piece of code in a version of the computer worm prevents the program from harming machines in ukraine , leading some to believe that ' s where the program ' s author lives . others say that could be a ploy . many authors of previous computer viruses have come from eastern europe outside the jurisdiction of the european union , experts said . matt watchinski , senior director of a research team at sourcefire , a computer security company , said the author may try to split up pieces of the infected computer network called a botnet and sell them to bidders . the many unknowns about conficker are what make it particularly concerning , said patrick morganelli , senior vice president of technology for enigma software . "" an attack could happen today , it could happen april 15 , it could happen two months from now , "" he said . henry says an attack will happen sooner or later . "" they ' ll wait for the hype to subside , "" he said .

"but the obama administration ' s handling of the bowe bergdahl saga attempting , according to a member of congress , to pay an intermediary for his safe return and then trading five high value taliban terrorists for him when that failed suggests the white house ' s policy is less than consistent . obama told buzzfeed that ' as a general rule , what we don ' t want to do is make other american citizens riper targets ' for groups like the isis terror army by handing over millions of dollars for hostages . ' we devoted enormous resources , and always devote enormous resources , to freeing captives or hostages anywhere in the world , ' obama said , ' and i deployed an entire operation at significant risk to rescue not only mueller , but the other individuals that had been held and probably missed them by a day or two . ' president obama told buzzfeed in his latest unconventional media interview that america still won ' t pay to ransom hostages , but his handling of the bowe bergdahl saga raises questions about how the situation of kayla mueller ' s capture was handled kayla mueller , 26 , an american humanitarian worker from prescott , arizona , died according to isis when a jordanian airstrike leveled a buildign in syria terri crippes ( left ) and lori lyon ( right ) , the aunts of kayla mueller , grieved on tuesday after the 26 year old ' s death was confirmed although the circumstances in which she perished remain unclear obama launched a similar rescue mission to go after bergdahl , a us army soldier who walked away from his post in 2009 . but unlike in the mueller case , the administration also tried to make what a california congressman characterized as a random delivery to free bergdahl , who will likely be charged with desertion when the results of a pentagon investigation are made public . rep . duncan hunter said in november that the defense department attempted to pay the terrorist haqqani network in pakistan , which was holding bergdahl , but was duped by a con man who ran off with the money . the pentagon said on june 9 , 2014 that ' there was no money exchanged for bergdahl ' s release . ' the white house ' s national security council insisted a day later that ' the united states did not provide money in exchange for sgt . bergdahl ' s release . ' those carefully parsed statements , however , allow for the possibility that duncan is right : money was sent but never reached its intended recipient . the administration ' can deny it all they want , ' he said . he added that the federal government has long included ransom plans among possible outcomes during hostage crises , using third party ' cutouts ' to maintain deniability .

' in the aftermath of the mueller murder at isis ' s hands , obama cautioned that paying ransoms would mean ' not only are we financing their slaughter of innocent people and strengthening their organization , but we ' re actually making americans even greater targets for future kidnappings . ' after the 5 for 1 bergdahl swap , a taliban commander in afghanistan told time magazine that americans can expect to see more kidnappings as terrorists seek to free more of their leaders from us custody .

"these are the words i like to begin each day with , stating my intent out loud . somehow it seems if i actually hear it , it ' s easier to live it and believe it . i have crohn ' s disease , for which there is no cure a disease that requires a daily personal battle with things most of us prefer not to discuss with others . and for those who must deal with it , one thing is certain . it ' s horrible , it ' s overwhelming , and it ' s humiliating . the humiliation factor is a major reason so many suffer in silence the evidence of the disease and the treatments are things you just don ' t tell others about . so you find yourself facing the challenges alone the pain that literally doubles you over without warning : nausea , life threatening bowel obstructions , incontinence , dehydration , intravenous feeding , fatigue and depression . there is also the ever present threat of surgery , ostomies and permanent damage to my body . there are long days without any food or water , followed by multiple days of clear liquids only . doctors : a new era in crohn ' s disease each person suffering from the disease will have their own private hell made up of variations of these components , but all will share the guarantee of loss of normal life , and the knowledge that there is no cure . during my worst times it ' s been so tough that , exhausted from battling the pain , frustration and fear , i ' ve cried myself to sleep on the bathroom floor . there are many , many drugs and some forms of chemotherapy treatments that may bring about remission in crohn ' s cases but no guarantees . and even with remission , the fear and questions linger will it come back ? every healthy day is a blessing that carries a black cloud on the horizon . there is relief as you realize you have a reprieve from the disease but a lingering sense of anxiety as you contemplate the "" what if "" that hangs just above your head , depriving you of real peace . it ' s a daily struggle to keep the fear and uncertainty at bay and enjoy the moments that feel "" normal . "" so i will focus just on today . teen diagnoses her crohn ' s disease in science class i rise early so i can exercise exercise helps battle the fatigue that , because of an inability to absorb nutrition from food , is the out of control demon affecting each day . i dress for work , pack my small meals and snacks from the very short list of things that i can easily digest . others will see the confinements of my diet as depressing , but for me they are delicacies that are far preferable to the too often required clear liquid diet . the freedom to consume real food , and to do so by mouth instead of through a tube , is a gift i treasure at each meal , and that i never take for granted . saying blessings before my meals has taken on a new meaning as i give thanks and pray that some nourishment will be retained as my food speeds through my system . this is important to prevent dehydration and or artificial feeding . next , i fill my pill divider with the 13 doses of six medications i will take that day , almost hourly . four times a month , i ' ll give myself a scheduled injection of vitamin b12 . monthly injections from a caregiver are part of the drill twice a month , but if today is not one of those days , i ' m good to go . there will be no spontaneity to my day . a sudden , last minute invitation to lunch will be met with "" i ' d love to , but i already have plans , "" a small white lie that keeps me from having to explain . an invite to dinner , drinks , a movie or shopping will be met with a similar excuse . trying not to appear anti social while repeatedly declining all invitations has resulted in a neat little list of interchangeable excuses . even a meeting will require advance notice and preparation if it takes place around a meal . menus must be reviewed in advance , and medication dosages slightly altered . and more often than not , even with all this preparation it will just turn out to be "" a bad day "" and a last minute cancellation will be unavoidable . occasionally this happens around events that are really important to me , such as a wedding or a family member ' s funeral . missing these events brings frustration , anger and eventually leaves me in tears . but acceptance will finally come as i make peace with what i know can ' t be changed . so most days , it ' s easier to just give in and have no plans . i can replace the anxiety of "" what happens if "" with the comfort and security of home , where my safe foods , medicine , supplies and a comfortable resting place all reside . i need the downtime and the extra rest , because tomorrow i ' ll do it all again . my battle closely resembles the battle fought by those with colon cancer . suffering from crohn ' s disease can mean debilitating pain , fistula surgery and diarrhea that can be so severe it can bring on dehydration . like colon cancer , remission is possible , but recurrence is probable . like colon cancer , a variety of medications and treatments can help with the effects , but they are strong medications that bring their own set of problems and risks . while crohn ' s disease itself is not terminal , the complications often result in death . keeping it under control requires a real commitment to fight and a resolve to sustain that commitment every day . the motivation to fight is the strong desire to not suffer , and deviation often results in serious illness . each surgery or flare up leaves me with a little bigger battle to face , so i keep fighting . and yet i do feel lucky lucky to be alive and grateful to be in the midst of a season of fewer struggles . i am blessed , and i truly understand that in the big scheme of things this struggle is but a moment . and in this season of reprieve . i carry the cold knowledge that there are more than 1 million other people suffering like me . so few people understand this disease , yet it ' s part of the lives of so many people all around them . i hope to help change that . i tell my story only to help bring a little attention to what life is like for those who battle crohn ' s because sharing equals attention , and attention equals awareness . and awareness builds hope that something can be done maybe not in my lifetime , but perhaps in my children ' s . that ' s important because the probability of my children being diagnosed increased the day i was diagnosed . so today , i share . and today i will fight again , with every intention of winning . crohn ' s diagnosis means lifelong battle",1,words like begin day  stating intent loud  somehow

"the kurdish city of kobane on the border of syria and turkey has been the scene of fierce fighting for weeks now between kurdish resistance forces and the advancing isis jihadists . in a show of solidarity for the embattled kurds , protesters in france , britain and germany today called on their governments to provide further assistance to the city ' s kurdish fighters . demonstrators hold banners and signs in parliament square , london , in a show of support for the kurds the protests in parliament square , london , turned sour when angry demonstrators clashed with police a man is restrained during a clash with police officers during the london demonstration another man is held by an officer attempting to maintain order during the impassioned protest a demonstrator holds a placard in a show of solidarity with the inhabitants of kobane , who are currently battling isis forces police officers and demonstrators line up face to face in parliament square , westminster although the us has conducted air strikes on targets within the city , isis has tightened its grip on the town in recent days and thousands of kurds face massacre should turkey not open its border to allow the delivery of arms . the kurds , an ethnic group spread across much of the middle east have borne the brunt of much of the war against isis . in recent months kurds in northern iraq have defended , and in some instances successfully retaken , cities along the iraq border from the jihadists . however , it is their attempts to halt the isis takeover of kobane , in syria , which triggered today ' s demonstrations . in london protesters bearing placards and flags were marshalled by police as they marched on parliament square , westminster . the demonstration later became heated when the angry protesters clashed with the police force security cordons . a similar demonstration took place in paris , with thousands marching through the city to try and force a french government commitment to help the kurds and pile pressure on the turkish government . and in germany , more than 20 , 000 kurdish immigrants undertook a demonstration in the western city of duesseldorf . police said the german demonstration was peaceful with people marching through the city ' s downtown area and waving large kurdish flags . similar protests in germany last week had turned violent when kurds clashed with supporters of a hard line islamic movement . the protest in duesseldorf , germany , comprised 20 , 000 people many of whom were expatriate kurds germany ' s large kurdish population has been vocal in recent days with today ' s demonstration just the latest protest against the turkish government ' s lack of assistance demonstrators in duesseldorf carry a giant portrait of abdullah ocalan , the founder of the militant organization kurdistan workers ' party meanwhile , the kurdish forces defending kobane have urged the us led coalition to escalate air strikes on isis fighters who have tightened their grip on the border town . the kurdish forces are now believed to face inevitable defeat in kobane if turkey does not open its border to let through arms something ankara has so far appeared reluctant to do . the us led coalition escalated air strikes on isis in and around kobane , also known as ayn al arab , some four days ago . the main kurdish armed group , the ypg , said in a statement the air strikes had inflicted heavy losses on isis , but had been less effective in the last two days . a protest was also held in france today . the demonstrators ' banner reads : ' what are you waiting for to act ? a new massacre ' in reference to the potential slaughter of kurds trapped in kobane by isis forces thousands march the streets of paris in an attempt to force the french government into helping the kurds two protesters , wearing bright orange jumpsuits join the demonstration in paris . their signs translate to : ' islamic state killed me ' and ' kobane died , france where are your great values ? ' a kurdish military official , speaking from kobane , said street to street fighting was making it harder for the warplanes to target isis positions . ' we have a problem , which is the war between houses , ' said esmat al sheikh , head of the kobane defence council . ' the air strikes are benefiting us , but islamic state is bringing tanks and artillery from the east . we didn ' t see them with tanks , but yesterday we saw t 57 tanks , ' he added . while isis has been able to reinforce its fighters , the kurds have not . the militants have besieged the town to the east , south and west , meaning the kurds ' only possible supply route is the turkish border to the north . isis has released a propaganda video purporting to show its militants fighting in the city of kobane ( pictured ) the video includes this scene of a gunman firing at kurds while stationed on a high rooftop the u . n . envoy to syria on friday called on turkey to help prevent a slaughter in kobane , asking it to let ' volunteers ' cross the frontier so they could reinforce the kurdish forces defending the town that lies within sight of turkish territory . turkey has also yet to respond to the remarks by staffan de mistura , who said he feared a repeat of the 1995 srebrenica massacre in bosnia when thousands died . kurdish leaders in syria have asked ankara to establish a corridor through turkey to allow aid and military supplies to reach kobane . ' ( isis ) is getting supplies and men , while turkey is preventing kobane from getting ammunition . even with the resistance , if things stay like this , the kurdish forces will be like a car without fuel , ' said rami abdelrahman , who runs the syrian observatory for human rights , an organisation that monitors the conflict in syria through sources on the ground . a member of isis shoots at resistance forces with a high caliber gun in the streets of kobane an isis jihadist fires a rocket propelled grenade during the street fighting in kobane while much of the population has already fled kobane , 500 700 mostly elderly people are still in the town , while 10 , 000 13 , 000 are nearby in a border area between syria and turkey , u . n . envoy de mistura said . the observatory said no fewer than 226 kurdish fighters and 298 islamic state militants had been killed since the group launched its kobane offensive in mid september . it said the overall death toll including civilians was probably much higher . the kobane crisis has sparked deadly violence in turkey , which has a kurdish population numbering 15million . turkish kurds have risen up since tuesday against president tayyip erdogan ' s government , which they accuse of allowing their kin to be slaughtered . at least 33 people have been killed in three days of riots across the mainly kurdish southeast , including two police officers shot dead in an apparent attempt to assassinate a police chief . the police chief was wounded . a senior kurdish militant has threatened turkey with a new kurdish revolt if it sticks with its current policy of non intervention in the battle for kobane .",1,kurdish city kobane border syria turkey scene fierce fighting weeks kurdish resistance forces advancing isis jihadists  show

"his head traces the ball into the outfield with each crack of a bat . nationals park is one of several major league baseball parks that he has visited this summer with his little league team , the anderson monarchs . as a tribute to jackie robinson and the negro leagues , the inner city team traveled back in time aboard a vintage 1947 flxible clipper touring bus , once used by the newark eagles , for the ultimate road trip . the three week , 4 , 000 mile journey gave the team from south philadelphia a glimpse at what robinson and other players went through during the barnstorming days of the negro leagues . r . a . dickey and the zen of the knuckleball "" i ' ll never forget this , "" said 10 year old eaddy . "" it ' s hard to explain . it ' s really fun . i get to do all this stuff , meet all these people . it ' s a once in a lifetime opportunity . "" along the cross country trip , the monarchs played games against local youth teams , met surviving players from the negro leagues and visited historic sites such as robinson ' s grave site in brooklyn , the field of dreams in iowa and the negro leagues baseball museum in kansas city , missouri . then it ' s back on the road in the sweltering heat on the un air conditioned bus with no electronic games to pass the time a reminder of the traveling conditions the early baseball pioneers endured .

"for example , in the last few months top hamas officials have publicly stressed that they want to be part of the solution of the palestinian israeli conflict , not part of the problem . what is happening inside hamas ' mosques and social base shows a concerted effort on the part of its leadership to re educate its rank and file about co existence with the jewish state and in so doing mentally prepare them for a permanent settlement in the future . in gazan mosques , pro hamas clerics have begun to cite the example of salah al din al ayubi , a famed muslim military commander and statesman , who , after liberating jerusalem from the western crusaders , allowed them to retain a coastal state of their own . the moral lesson of the story is that if the famed leader could tolerate the warring , bloodthirsty crusaders , then today ' s palestinians should be willing to live peacefully with a jewish state in their midst . this story is important because it provides hamas with religious legitimacy and allows it to justify and explain its change of direction to followers . as an islamic based movement , hamas ' very raison d ' etre rests on religious legitimization , and its leaders understand that they neglect that at their peril . hamas ' recent narrative marks a pronounced departure from the past in which hamas moderates called for a minor or long term truce . now hamas leaders appear to be going further by laying the ground for a shift in their position by educating their social base about the requirements of permanent peace recognition of the jewish state . although the evolution of hamas ' stance on the peace process has been slow , gradual and qualified , in the last three years many of its leaders repeatedly have said they wanted a two state solution . pressed by an australian journalist on policy changes that hamas might make to any new order , khaled meshaal , the top hamas leader and head of its political bureau based in syria and considered a hard liner , asserted that the organization has already shifted on several key points : "" hamas already changed we accepted the national accords for a palestinian state based on 1967 borders , and we took part in the 2006 palestinian elections . "" over the years , i have interviewed more than a dozen hamas leaders inside and outside the palestinian territories . although , on the whole , hamas ' public rhetoric calls for the liberation of all historic palestine , not only the territories occupied in 1967 , a healthier debate occurs within . my recent conversations with hamas ' rank and file suggest that the militant organization has evolved considerably since the group unexpectedly won power in gaza in free elections in 2006 . before then , hamas was known for its suicide bombers , not its bureaucrats . but that had to change . "" it is much more difficult to run a government than to oppose and resist israeli occupation , "" a senior hamas leader told me while on official business in egypt in 2007 . "" if we do not provide the goods to our people , they ' ll disown us . "" ironically , in spite of the west ' s refusal to regard this government as legitimate , the democratic demands for governance from within gaza are themselves driving change within hamas . what is striking about hamas ' recent shift of opinion toward the peace process is that it has come at a trying time for the islamist organization which , in the last two years , has faced critical challenges from al qaeda like jihadist groups , a low intensity civil war with rival fatah , the ruling party of the palestinian authority , and a deteriorating humanitarian situation in gaza . last summer a militant group called jund ansar allah , or the warriors of god , one of a handful of radical al qaeda inspired factions , declared the establishment of an islamic caliphate in gaza , a flagrant rejection of hamas ' authority . hamas security forces struck instantly and mercilessly at the warriors , killing more than 20 members , including the group ' s leader , abdel latif moussa . in one stroke , the hamas leadership sent a message to its foes and friends that it will not tolerate the existence of global jihadist groups such as al qaeda : hamas will not allow al qaeda inspired factions to turn gaza into a theater to wage transnational jihad . however , the challenge to hamas ' authority persists . israel ' s punishing siege of gaza , in place since 2007 , along with the suffering and despair it has caused to its 1 . 4 million inhabitants , has driven hundreds of young palestinians into the arms of small salafist extremist factions that accuse hamas of forfeiting the armed struggle and failing to implement quranic or shariah law . operationally and ideologically , there are huge differences between hamas and al qaeda and its various inspired factions , and a lot of bad blood . hamas is a broad based religious nationalist resistance whose focus and violence is limited to palestine israel , while al qaeda is a small , transnational terrorist group that has carried out attacks worldwide . thus hamas , unlike al qaeda and other fringe factions , is not merely an armed militia but a viable social movement with a large popular base that has been estimated at more than half a million supporters and sympathizers . hamas also has shown itself to be sensitive and responsive to palestinian public opinion . a further example of its political and social priorities is hamas ' decision to engage seriously with an egyptian brokered deal that sketches out a path to peace with rival fatah . despite its reactionary rhetoric , hamas is a rational actor , a conclusion reached by former mossad chief ephraim halevy , who also was ariel sharon ' s national security adviser and who is certainly not an israeli peacenik . the hamas leadership has undergone a transformation "" right under our very noses "" by recognizing that "" its ideological goal is not attainable and will not be in the foreseeable future , "" halevy wrote in yedioth ahronoth a few months ago . his verdict is that hamas is now ready and willing to accept the establishment of a palestinian state within the temporary borders of 1967 . yet if hamas is so eager to accept a two state solution , why doesn ' t it simply announce that it recognizes israel ' s existence and promise to negotiate a peace deal that allows the two countries to coexist ? in interviews with hamas officials , they stress that their organization has made significant concessions to the so called quartet ' s three conditions , though the quartet ( the united nations , russia , united states and european union ) has not lifted the punishing sanctions against hamas nor has it effectively pressed israel . hamas ' diplomatic starting point will be to demand that israel recognizes the nationalist rights of the palestinians and withdraws from the occupied territories , but it will not be its final position . there could be no viable , lasting peace agreement between israel and the palestinians if hamas is not consulted about peacemaking and if the palestinians remain divided with two warring authorities in the west bank and in gaza . hamas has the means and public support to undermine any agreement that does not address the legitimate rights and claims of the palestinian people . its rival , fatah and the palestinian authority , lacks a popular mandate and the legitimacy needed to implement a resolution of the conflict . president mahmoud abbas has been politically weakened by a series of blunders of his own making and by pressure by the us , compromising his moral authority in the eyes of a sizable palestinian constituency . if , instead of ignoring hamas or , worse yet , seeking its overthrow , the united states and europe engaged the islamically based organization , diplomatically and politically , and encouraged it to continue moderating its views , the west could test the extent of hamas ' evolution and find out if the organization is willing to accept a settlement based on the two state solution . so far , the strategy of isolating and militarily confronting hamas pursued by israel and the bush administration has not appeared to weaken the organization dramatically . if anything , what success this strategy has had in undermining hamas has been counterproductive , since it has radicalized hundreds of young palestinians who have joined extremist al qaeda inspired factions and reinforced the culture of martyrdom and nihilism . to break this impasse , and prevent further gains by more extremist factions , the us and europe should support a unified palestinian government that could negotiate peace with israel . the ongoing egyptian brokered truce deal between hamas and fatah is an opportunity that may be built on to repair and strengthen intra palestinian governing institutions that have been frayed as a result of intense rivalry in the last two years . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of fawaz a .

""" as a couple , we dreamed of marrying for a long time , "" freyre told the state run telam news agency . their marriage was hailed as a victory by gay rights groups in argentina , though it was unknown whether the legality of their marriage would face any challenges . after a legal battle earlier this year , a court in the capital , buenos aires , ruled that a ban on same sex marriage was illegal and ordered the proper authorities to grant the couple a marriage license if they applied for one . on the eve of their december 1 wedding , however , another court filed an injunction , putting the brakes on the nuptials . in argentina , the issue of same sex marriage is decided on the local and state level . so freyre and di bello went to the southernmost state of tierra del fuego , where a pro gay marriage governor welcomed the event , telam reported . although the federal government could not directly intervene , argentina ' s national institute against xenophobia and racism ( inadi ) helped find a friendly jurisdiction where the couple could have their wedding , the institute ' s president , claudio morgado , told telam . morgado was even a witness at the ceremony . "" this is the purpose of inadi , to safeguard the rights of citizens who do not fully enjoy these rights , "" morgado said , according to the state run news agency . the original ruling against a ban on gay marriage was made on november 10 by buenos aires trial level judge gabriela seijas . her decision applied only to buenos aires . "" the law should treat each person with equal respect in relation to each person ' s singularities without the need to understand or regulate them , "" seijas said in her ruling . buenos aires mayor mauricio macri said after the ruling that his government would not appeal the decision , but a second trial judge filed an injunction until the issue could be considered further . countries in latin america , a region strongly identified with the catholic church , have recently given more attention to gay rights . earlier this month , mexico city ' s legislative assembly passed a bill legalizing gay marriage there . in september , uruguay became the first latin american country to allow same sex adoption . brazil , colombia and ecuador are also addressing the issue of same sex civil unions .",1, couple  dreamed marrying long time   freyre told state run telam news agency  marriage hailed victory gay rights groups argentina  though unknown whether legality marriage would face challenges  legal battle earlier year  court capital  buenos aires  ruled ban sex marriage illegal ordered proper authorities grant couple marriage license applied one  eve december 1 wedding  however  another court filed injunction  putting brakes nuptials  argentina  issue sex marriage decided local state level  freyre di bello went southernmost state tierra del fuego  pro gay marriage governor welcomed event  telam reported  although federal government could directly intervene  argentina  national institute xenophobia racism  inadi  helped find friendly jurisdiction couple could wedding  institute  president  claudio morgado  told telam  morgado even witness ceremony   purpose inadi  safeguard rights citizens fully enjoy rights   morgado said  according state run news agency  original ruling ban gay marriage made november 10 buenos aires trial level judge gabriela seijas  decision applied buenos aires   law treat person equal respect relation person  singularities without need understand regulate   seijas said ruling  buenos aires mayor mauricio macri said ruling government would appeal decision  second trial judge filed injunction issue could considered  countries latin america  region strongly identified catholic church  recently given attention gay rights  earlier month  mexico city  legislative assembly passed bill legalizing gay marriage  september  uruguay became first latin american country allow sex adoption  brazil  colombia ecuador also addressing issue sex civil unions ,government

"savile ' s nephew , roger foster , had defended his late uncle who hosted shows watched and heard by a generation of young britons in a newspaper interview before the allegations emerged in a tv documentary a month ago . but as those few claims snowballed into hundreds , the family had to face up to the horrific truth : that the man they were so proud of as a media star and indefatigable charity fundraiser had a far darker side to his past . a statement released saturday by foster spells out the family ' s anguish and their deep sympathy for as many as 300 victims preyed on by savile . the documentary made them aware of "" allegations of a darker side to him that we knew nothing about , "" foster says and the claims swiftly began to overwhelm the family . "" i watched the program in horror and could not believe that these allegations were about our uncle . this wasn ' t the man we knew and loved , "" he says . "" we began to have doubts as to our own feeling towards our uncle . how could the person we thought we knew and loved do such a thing ? "" why would a man who raised so much money for charity , who gave so much of his own time and energy for others risk it all doing indecent criminal acts ? how could anyone live their life doing the ' most good and most evil ' at the same time ? "" profile : idolised in life , reviled in death the family took the "" difficult "" decision to remove savile ' s headstone , only placed on his grave a couple of weeks earlier , as they feared it could become a target for spiraling public outrage and so disrupt the peace of the cemetery for others . "" a vilification of his name , his achievements and everything he stood for followed . people are moving as quickly as possible to disassociate themselves from him , "" foster continues . "" we recognize that even our own despair and sadness does not compare to that felt by the victims . our thoughts and our prayers are with those who have suffered from every kind of abuse over so many years and we offer our deepest sympathy in what must have been a terrible time for all of them . ex scout tells of abuse "" we can understand their reluctance to say anything earlier and can appreciate the courage it has taken to speak out now . "" meanwhile , savile ' s family waits to see what new horrors may emerge . "" where will it all end ? who knows ? the repercussions of this scandal are enormous . we , as his closest family , have to endure further revelations on a daily basis . our feelings are in turmoil as we await the next turn of events , "" foster concludes . in another blow to savile ' s legacy , a senior archbishop has urged the vatican to strip him of his papal knighthood , awarded by pope john paul ii in 1990 . the archbishop of westminster , the most rev . vincent nichols , wrote to pope benedict xvi to ask if the honor could be posthumously removed , "" recognising the deep distress of all those who have suffered abuse and the disquiet at mr savile ' s name remaining on papal honours lists , "" a spokesman said . "" while the outcome of the current police investigation is awaited , the allegations of abuse are deeply shocking and our thoughts go first to all those who have been abused , "" said the spokesman for nichols , who heads the catholic church in england and wales . police say they are preparing an arrest strategy for "" others , "" still living , against whom allegations have been made in connection with the savile case . commander peter spindler told reporters thursday that police investigating the scandal were dealing with about 300 apparent victims , of whom all except two are women . they had spoken to 130 as of thursday and identified 114 offenses committed , he said . officers are following more than 400 lines of inquiry in the case , most of them involving savile , he said , but no one has been arrested or interviewed under caution . "" i have no doubt we are at a watershed moment for child abuse investigations , "" spindler said . he said he wanted to reassure victims that they will no longer be "" uncredible "" and that they will be given a voice . many of the allegations date back to the 1960s and ' 70s , complicating the current investigation . some police forces also face questions over reports made in the past to police regarding savile , which did not result in any prosecution . countless britons who grew up watching savile on tv ' s "" top of the pops "" and his children ' s program "" jim ' ll fix it "" have been left reeling by the slew of claims against him in the past month . the reputation of the british broadcasting corporation , for whom he worked , has also been tainted by the scandal amid questions over how his abuse went undetected , and its decision to drop a program investigating allegations him last year . how scandal has rocked bbc the bbc , on whose premises some of the sexual assaults occurred , has said it is horrified by the revelations and has launched two independent inquiries . savile died in october 2011 at age 84 , soon after being treated in a hospital for pneumonia . his death was followed by a series of glowing tributes , including two bbc christmas specials .",1,savile  nephew  roger foster  defended late uncle hosted shows watched heard generation young britons newspaper interview allegations emerged tv documentary month ago  claims snowballed hundreds  family face horrific truth  man proud media star indefatigable charity fundraiser far darker side past  statement released saturday foster spells family  anguish deep sympathy many 300 victims preyed savile  documentary made aware  allegations darker side knew nothing   foster says claims swiftly began overwhelm family   watched program horror could believe allegations uncle   man knew loved   says   began doubts feeling towards uncle  could person thought knew loved thing   would man raised much money charity  gave much time energy others risk indecent criminal acts  could anyone live life  good evil  time   profile  idolised life  reviled death family took  difficult  decision remove savile  headstone  placed grave couple weeks earlier  feared could become target spiraling public outrage disrupt peace cemetery others   vilification name  achievements everything stood followed  people moving quickly possible disassociate   foster continues   recognize even despair sadness compare felt victims  thoughts prayers suffered every kind abuse many years offer deepest sympathy must terrible time  ex scout tells abuse  understand reluctance say anything earlier appreciate courage taken speak   meanwhile  savile  family waits see new horrors may emerge   end  knows  repercussions scandal enormous   closest family  endure revelations daily basis  feelings turmoil await next turn events   foster concludes  another blow savile  legacy  senior archbishop urged vatican strip papal knighthood  awarded pope john paul ii 1990  archbishop westminster  rev  vincent nichols  wrote pope benedict xvi ask honor could posthumously removed   recognising deep distress suffered abuse disquiet mr savile  name remaining papal honours lists   spokesman said   outcome current police investigation awaited  allegations abuse deeply shocking thoughts go first abused   said spokesman nichols  heads catholic church england wales  police say preparing arrest strategy  others   still living  allegations made connection savile case  commander peter spindler told reporters thursday police investigating scandal dealing 300 apparent victims  except two women  spoken 130 thursday identified 114 offenses committed  said  officers following 400 lines inquiry case  involving savile  said  one arrested interviewed caution   doubt watershed moment child abuse investigations   spindler said  said wanted reassure victims longer  uncredible  given voice  many allegations date back 1960s  70s  complicating current investigation  police forces also face questions reports made past police regarding savile  result prosecution  countless britons grew watching savile tv   top pops  children  program  jim  fix  left reeling slew claims past month  reputation british broadcasting corporation  worked  also tainted scandal amid questions abuse went undetected  decision drop program investigating allegations last year  scandal rocked bbc bbc  whose premises sexual assaults occurred  said horrified revelations launched two independent inquiries  savile died october 2011 age 84  soon treated hospital pneumonia  death followed series glowing tributes  including two bbc christmas specials ,family

"a heart breaking defeat on penalties in their quarterfinal was preceded by 120 minutes which saw the style of finalists italy overwhelm english pragmatism and conquer their heart on sleeve spirit . so why does england continue to employ this bulldog style ? and why can ' t the country who gave birth to the game reinvent itself like the all conquering spain team , who will be gunning for a third consecutive major title against italy in kiev on sunday , or the dynamic germans , young pretenders who fell at the semifinal stage ? the answer , according to two respected authors , is history , and how the nation ' s deep rooted view of masculinity has molded its soccer style . until that changes , this relentless cycle of disappointment will continue . david winner , who wrote "" brilliant orange , "" a study of how dutch culture and psyche contributed to the influence their football visionaries have had on the game , argues england ' s approach to football has not changed for over half a century . "" every time it comes as surprise when english heart , commitment and valor and all these old victorian values come unstuck against much more skilful opponents . "" italy reach semifinals after penalty kicks drama the breeding ground for this english style of football has its roots in the boisterous games of the medieval period , winner argues , and the intrinsic love for "" testosterone festivals "" like rugby , which was invented around the same time as soccer . for him , the attritional modus operandi showcased by england during sunday ' s morale sapping defeat to a far more fluent italy side shows the national game is still weighed down by this regressive approach . "" the game is profoundly rooted in old english stuff and we never lost that , "" he adds . "" we love the battlers like ( former england players ) terry butcher , stuart pearce and tony adams . "" "" the idea the game is all about skill and you express your manliness not by fighting but by your skill in being able to do very delicate things that affronts something deep in the english male psyche and i don ' t see any change to it . "" winner ' s view is shared by simon kuper , journalist and co author of "" soccernomics , "" a book about football ' s truths , who subscribes to the view that england ' s methodology was spawned from a notion that the soldier was society ' s greatest role model . this then infiltrated the nation ' s best loved game , reinforcing the idea of a "" warrior "" culture , when grit and determination were valued over technical skill . the stats from euro 2012 back this theory up , with england blocking more shots on goal and putting in more tackles than any other nation upon their exit . "" in northern europe , in general , we tend to value discipline and sticking to your task highly , "" said kuper . "" the collective discipline is important and england and germany are examples of that . we live in countries where that is valued . you don ' t lose yourself in personal creativity , you do your job . "" the model for the british man is the soldier , maybe even still is . the tabloids talk about our players as soldiers , so the values that are very highly praised in english football are bravery , passion , obedience , hard work and you don ' t tend to hear that much talk about creativity and inspiration , which are not soldierly virtues . "" but it isn ' t all gloom and doom for england . hope can be extracted from two titans of europe , spain and germany , both of whom radically revamped their approach to the game in the last 15 years . for decades , spain were one of soccer ' s greatest underachievers , entrenched in a style that emerged from what general franco termed "" la furia espa ola , "" or the spanish fury . like england , spain ' s values were immersed in hard work and fight . time and time again spain promised much but failed to deliver on the biggest stage . it was not until after the turn of the century their traditional tactics were abandoned , and a new style executed by a generation of emerging players started to yield unprecedented results . winner insists the revolution was brought about by spanish giants barcelona , and their modern interpretation on the netherlands teams of the 1970s , led by johan cruyff , who were said to play "" total football . "" during his stint as manager of barcelona , cruyff ' s doctrine permeated the club , and he played a key role in the establishment of its "" la masia "" youth academy that has produced so many gifted players that now make up the backbone for the national team . "" look at how the spanish used to play and the way they play now , "" winner explains . "" there ' s almost no point of contact between the two styles . "" reinventing the wheel : how guardiola revolutionized football germany have also undergone a relatively recent transformation , shedding their traditional , battling , hardworking approach after poor returns at the 1998 world cup in france and the european championships two years later . their past triumphs in both competitions germany can boast three titles in each tournament were conducted in a manner far removed from the way the current side operate , with skilful and exciting players like mesut ozil and thomas muller at their forefront . "" those changes are apparent now this is the first generation to benefit , "" he said . "" if you have those technical players at your disposal then that will affect they way you play . "" there was a realization that the bundesliga ' s power and success saw an increase in foreigners and that young german players weren ' t coming through . one of the reasons they identified was the coaching wasn ' t up to scratch anymore . "" they invested lots of money into coaching and youth development and they produced better players . as a result better all round players were being produced . they gave someone like coach joachim low many more options . "" germany knock greece out of euros england ' s quarterfinal defeat has prompted a familiar round of introspection as journalists , pundits , players and managers put forward their blueprint for a bright new future . yet the national team ' s malaise is at odds with the global success enjoyed by its domestic competition . the english premier league is regularly described as the best , most exciting league in the world , borne out by the record amounts of money broadcasters pay to televise it . the next slab of tv rights in the uk was recently sold for 3 billion . but would the premier league punters welcome a move away from traditional values , which often provide open and frenetic matches , if it meant england were able to re establish themselves as an international force ? "" people would like england to be a winning team but they aren ' t willing to go through the changes to make it possible , "" winner added . "" if english clubs team were good enough to play the way spain do get a one goal lead and close it out by keeping the ball no club crowd would tolerate that for more than 20 minutes . they ' d scream ' get it upfield . ' "" we ' d find that boring and the crowds would stay away , and they ' d also find it unmanly . "" prior to england ' s humiliating 4 1 defeat to germany in the second round of the 2010 world cup , the fa embarked on a process to develop a new philosophy for how the national game should be played , and it has subsequently made changes to the way youngsters are coached . andy hilton , a development officer at the coalface of grassroots football in manchester , says coaching methods and the attitude of parents who would perpetuate the "" win at all costs mentality "" are also starting to change . he and his colleagues are trying to mesh the traditional english "" warrior "" style with the more cultured flavor of spain and germany , in order to produce players who are comfortable in any type of match situation . "" with the older age groups of 15 and over , the english ' warrior ' is still the dominant football force . players love street football moves to beat and humiliate an opponent but the game is high tempo , high octane power and speed with an edge of violence , "" hilton said . "" conversely with the younger players many coaches are concentrating on manipulating the ball , being comfortable with it , and not being afraid to dribble or pass it when the situation dictates . "" i suppose the question is how do we keep the tiki taka with young adulthood from childhood ? testosterone , body changes and finding their niche in society forces players to conform to the warrior or look lesser in others ' eyes . "" both winner and kuper agree that england needs a new model , and beginning with a detailed look at how spain and germany transformed their fortunes would be a productive starting point . in the meantime , until any of these changes take hold , perhaps the best thing for english fans to do is lower expectations and prepare for an immediate future laden with modest returns . "" the future is only bleak in terms of winning tournaments england are not going to do that , "" said winner . "" but they ' ll bring the nation some pleasure and get out of their group most years . they qualify for tournaments almost always . "" we have to change our expectations as a nation , stop having this post imperial sense that we are entitled to win because we invented the game , and be a bit realistic .

"" if you don ' t help those who are dependent , you are half way there because they are going to commit crime to get money and pay for the drug , "" gaviria said . cardoso said the group called for only the decriminalization of marijuana and not other illicit drugs because "" you have to start somewhere "" and it would have been unrealistic to ask the same for all drugs , efe said . marijuana was chosen because it is grown in all countries in the region and because it is "" less harmful .

"but expert dr leonard press said this can only happen if the eye is permanently covered before the age of seven it ' s a hairstyle favoured by celebs from rihanna to justin bieber and often copied by their young fans . but a leading optometrist has warned that having a side fringe that falls into the face can cause long term eye damage . hair raising : rihanna , left , and cameron diaz often wear a side fringe but could it damage their sight ? not according to experts amblyopia is more commonly known as a lazy eye and is a childhood condition which means the sufferer can ' t see as clearly out of one eye , so they rely on the other . it can occur as a child ' s sight develops so if a child has one of their eyes blocked , eg by an eye patch , when they are in a key developmental stage then they could develop a lazy eye . mr hogan believes having a side fringe means the hair can become like an eye patch across the eye and so cause the condition , and also short sightedness , by restricting sunlight and stimulation from reaching the eye . ' if you walk around with an eye patch on all day , then that eye will end up seeing more poorly than the other eye , ' he explained . emo trend : members of the band 30 seconds to mars favour the fringe across the face look he added that he was aware that visual development took place between birth to seven years , but that research had shown him vision could still be affected at later stages . but experts have poured cold water on mr hogan ' s theory . amblyopia specialist dr leonard press told msnbc : ' the story would only be true if you had somebody young enough , and if that person never looked out of that eye if it was blocked 24 7 . the reason it ' s false is that you don ' t have that constant deprivation .

"president obama is taking a huge step in his presidency . after weeks of careful deliberation , the president has sided with military officials who have been pushing for an escalation of us forces in afghanistan . explaining his objectives and exit strategy , obama is expected to announce that he will be sending 30 , 000 troops , and possibly more , into the region . with this decision , obama inches closer to becoming a wartime president . even though the white house insists that they will continue to work hard on their domestic agenda , historically , presidents who become involved in protracted ground wars find that their presidencies are defined by their military conflicts . the politics that surround a military operation play an enormous role in the political success or failure of an administration . speaker nancy pelosi and many congressional democrats realize the human and political risks that come from this war . as news broke of president obama ' s decision , pelosi said : "" the american people believe that if something is in our national security interest , we have to be able to afford it . that doesn ' t mean that we hold everything else "" stagnant because of those operations . but war sucks the political oxygen out of almost any presidency . there have been several modern presidents who started their term with an ambitious domestic vision and who ended up with their presidencies totally consumed by war . president harry truman , who served from 1945 to 1953 , pulled off a historic upset in his reelection bid against thomas dewey in 1948 . in the campaign , truman castigated a "" do nothing "" congress . when he returned to the white house after the election , truman fought for an ambitious domestic agenda in 1949 and 1950 , which he called the fair deal , which included national health care , civil rights , fair housing and more . while a conservative coalition of southern democrats and republicans in congress defeated most of his proposals , it was the korean war , which began in the summer of 1950 , that brought down his presidency . when the military operations against north korea bogged down into a stalemate by 1951 , republicans ripped into the administration for refusing to use enough air power against the communists . truman , whose approval ratings plummeted to 23 percent by 1952 , decided that he should not run for reelection . "" if we had been less trusting , if we had been less soft and weak , there would probably have been no war in korea ! "" republican candidate and military hero gen . dwight eisenhower said on the campaign trail . republicans focused their campaign on korea , communism and corruption . the democratic nominee , adlai stevenson , lost republicans gained control of congress . president lyndon johnson was on the verge of becoming a transformative president in the winter of 1965 . since taking office , johnson had presided over the passage of a sweeping body of domestic measures unequaled by almost any president in american history other than franklin roosevelt . his accomplishments included medicare and medicaid , federal education assistance , civil rights and voting rights , environmental regulations , immigration reform and much more . yet all those accomplishments seemed to disappear in the political psyche after the "" americanization "" of the war in the spring of 1965 , when johnson authorized a vast increase of ground troops to vietnam . by 1968 , public opinion had turned against the war , with anti war protesters organizing against "" johnson ' s war . "" in the history books , vietnam has swamped our memory of johnson ' s presidency and eclipsed much of what he accomplished in those early years . "" that bitch of a war , "" johnson lamented toward the end of his life , "" killed the lady i really loved the great society . "" most recently , there was the experience of president george w . bush . during the 2000 campaign and in the early months of his presidency , bush pushed for a type of "" compassionate conservatism "" that sought to extend certain kinds of government programs and establish the framework for a broad republican coalition that captured the center and right . the no child left behind act of 2001 extended the reach of the federal government into the nation ' s grade schools . after 9 11 , bush led a successful operation to knock the taliban out of power in afghanistan and dramatically reorganized homeland security . but once bush sent troops to iraq to bring down saddam hussein in 2003 , the war came to dominate everything else . as the reconstruction of iraq proved to be much more difficult than the white house anticipated , bush ' s popularity plummeted . in 2006 , democrats took control of congress and in 2008  , on a platform defined by his opposition to iraq , was elected president . there are modern presidents who have balanced their agendas and preserved domestic policy as an integral part of their political identity even after having sent troops to war . this was the certainly the case with fdr who protected many of his domestic programs and even expanded government into new areas at home as the war unfolded . but fdr is an exception to the rule . soon obama will be significantly expanding an existing military operation , making this war his own . in doing so , he will be risking a huge amount of his potential impact as a president . to make matters even worse , unlike johnson , obama has had more trouble pushing much of his domestic agenda through congress . while he will very likely walk away from this year with a victory on health care , most of his agenda remains bottled up . it is easy to see how afghanistan can quickly grow in scale and scope . it would be a tragedy if a politician who headed a historic campaign based on the promise of extracting the united states from a very unpopular war would wind up bogged down in a quagmire of his own . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of julian zelizer .",1,president
