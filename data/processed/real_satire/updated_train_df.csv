"" opinion : obama ' s ' best looking ' remark was sexist clearly , the president realized in hindsight that his comment didn ' t go over very well , and he has apologized . but i don ' t believe an apology was necessary . it ' s impossible to believe that anyone could seriously call president obama a chauvinist over this banter between friends . no matter your politics , you will have a hard time finding a president who has included women more in his agenda . what has he done for us lately ? let me recall just a few things : appointed two female supreme court justices , elena kagan and sonia sotomayor . appointed hillary clinton as secretary of state . signed the lilly ledbetter fair pay act , which restored worker protections against pay discrimination . the bill had failed in the senate in 2007 . i have disagreed with the president at times , but if potus is sexist , then we need more men just like him the world would be a much better place for women . in my book , when a person man or woman acknowledges someone ' s intellect and professionalism and then gives a lighthearted nod to her beauty , it ' s not sexist . it ' s just a compliment . throughout my career , i ' ve had to learn how to deal with men , and a few women , who made it a point to always comment on my looks , or tell jokes about women working in sports . early in my career , i admit , i was uncomfortable and wondered how to best handle the situation , not easy when you are many times the only woman in the newsroom . but even when i started out , i realized that context is everything , especially in the workplace , when talking about women and harassment . here ' s an example : one night , while i was working late in the office editing on deadline , a male co worker stumbled into my cubicle in a drunken stupor , he slung himself on my desk and leaned into me , slurring : "" roxanne , you ' re so beautiful . seriously , i ' ve been watching you . . . . why don ' t you pay attention to me ? "" now , that was creepy . and clearly it was sexual harassment . my bosses and the human resources department quickly dealt with the guy . in fact , his behavior was reported by a male colleague , who witnessed the entire thing , before i could even make the call . on another occasion , a senior executive speaking at an employee "" town hall "" meeting at work , pointed me out for a professional accomplishment , and then added : "" hey , roxanne looks like that woman on the show , ' the next top model . ' "" there was some laughter in the room but most of the women froze . i did not . i laughed and said : "" thanks , i ' m glad you like my new hairdo . "" sure , i knew immediately that the comment was a little awkward . but i was in no way offended . and i did not want the executive , who had always been a champion for women in the workplace , to get any backlash for his comment . he didn ' t deserve the criticism . honestly , when he made that comment i was more worried that my female colleagues would be angry with me . women might not want to admit this but we often hate women who look good , are smart and successful . just think : sheryl sandberg , facebook coo , or marissa meyer , yahoo ! ceo . maybe we ' ve been conditioned to believe the stereotypes . but none of us will achieve true equality in the workplace until we end this animus toward one another and focus on how to truly achieve power . luckily , sometimes life isn ' t serious . sometimes , we can laugh at ourselves and know that not every man is out to hold us down . and if we women are indeed confident in our abilities and our appearance no matter how we look on the outside then we should stop cowering every time a man notices us and makes a comment . stand up strong and take the compliment , but just make sure you ' re handling your business , because beauty is nothing without brains to match . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of roxanne jones .",1,would response california attorney general kamala harris  finds middle media dustup president obama introduced   far best looking attorney general country   fundraiser earlier week  harris beautiful woman   also super intelligent accomplished  president also noted  fact  lauded professional merits first   say take compliment move    slightly embarrassed comment  give back move  president obama  observation major offense women around globe  ridiculous flaps one always made uncomfortable calling feminist  especially means fly fit time man makes awkward comment woman  president  exact words  according white house transcript fundraiser   careful  first  say brilliant dedicated tough  exactly  want anybody administering law  making sure everybody getting fair shake  also happens far best looking attorney general country  kamala harris   applause    true  come   laughter   great friend great supporter many  many years   opinion  obama   best looking  remark sexist clearly  president realized hindsight comment  go well  apologized   believe apology necessary   impossible believe anyone could seriously call president obama chauvinist banter friends  matter politics  hard time finding president included women agenda  done us lately  let recall things  appointed two female supreme court justices  elena kagan sonia sotomayor  appointed hillary clinton secretary state  signed lilly ledbetter fair pay act  restored worker protections pay discrimination  bill failed senate 2007  disagreed president times  potus sexist  need men like world would much better place women  book  person man woman acknowledges someone  intellect professionalism gives lighthearted nod beauty   sexist   compliment  throughout career   learn deal men  women  made point always comment looks  tell jokes women working sports  early career  admit  uncomfortable wondered best handle situation  easy many times woman newsroom  even started  realized context everything  especially workplace  talking women harassment   example  one night  working late office editing deadline  male co worker stumbled cubicle drunken stupor  slung desk leaned  slurring   roxanne   beautiful  seriously   watching      pay attention    creepy  clearly sexual harassment  bosses human resources department quickly dealt guy  fact  behavior reported male colleague  witnessed entire thing  could even make call  another occasion  senior executive speaking employee  town hall  meeting work  pointed professional accomplishment  added   hey  roxanne looks like woman show   next top model    laughter room women froze   laughed said   thanks   glad like new hairdo   sure  knew immediately comment little awkward  way offended  want executive  always champion women workplace  get backlash comment   deserve criticism  honestly  made comment worried female colleagues would angry  women might want admit often hate women look good  smart successful  think  sheryl sandberg  facebook coo  marissa meyer  yahoo  ceo  maybe  conditioned believe stereotypes  none us achieve true equality workplace end animus toward one another focus truly achieve power  luckily  sometimes life  serious  sometimes  laugh know every man hold us  women indeed confident abilities appearance matter look outside stop cowering every time man notices us makes comment  stand strong take compliment  make sure  handling business  beauty nothing without brains match  opinions expressed commentary solely roxanne jones ,business

"pro life groups cried foul over monday s criminal indictments against two center for medical progress investigators because a prosecutor in the harris county district attorney s office is also a

coast . the district attorney s office was asked months ago about recusing itself from this case because one of its prosecutors serves as a board member of the planned parenthood affiliate involved in

parenthood , adding , she made the disclosure in order to be transparent . if at any time in the future , reliable and credible information is brought to my attention that would question our ability to continue to perform a fair , thorough and independent investigation of this matter due to her board membership , i will revisit the issue of seeking the appointment of an independent prosecutor and

"on the outside , painted on the dusty gray walls , are murals of brightly colored animals . inside on the worn out carpet sits a family , huddled together . masoma smiles shyly as we enter the room . the 25 year old mother of two invites me to sit on a deep red cushion , used at night for their bedding . her children five year old ali and eight year old mohammad sit close to their grandmother , zahra , who looks much older than her 54 years . masoma ' s sister , 20 year old fatima , and older brother husain , 27 , lean against the wall looking on as we set up for the interview . they may look like any normal afghan family , but they ' re hiding a shameful secret : they ' re all addicted to opium , the main ingredient of heroin . it is a drug so prevalent that one million afghans are addicted to it that ' s 8 of the population , according to the united nations . "" it ' s very bad , "" explains masoma . "" at first when i started to use the drug , it was like a medicine for pain relief after my husband died . but when i became completely addicted and needed it every day , i knew i had to search for a way to stop all this . "" masoma ' s mother , sister and older brother also used the drug to dull their pain when masoma ' s younger brother died soon after her husband . they too became addicted . "" it made us feel calm and gave us comfort , "" says masoma . "" when i felt bad about my husband and younger brother , using opium decreased my sorrow . "" after inhaling the additive smoke that often swirled around the house , masoma ' s two young children soon became addicted , without her even realizing . read more : afghan infants fed pure opium "" i feel shame , "" she tells me as her mother weeps in the background . "" i always say to myself , why did i do this ? why didn ' t i think about my children , my future ? people want nothing to do with us . "" that was until laila haidari found them . the local afghan woman set up mother camp in the abandoned school about a year ago . it ' s a place for drug addicts to live , escape their destructive environment and hopefully get clean . she and her small team of volunteers offer counseling to help the addicts become "" mentally strong . "" there is no government assistance to fund the program . instead the profits from a restaurant she owns keep mother camp running . "" i was sick of seeing all these drug addicts . they used to congregate under the pol e sukhta bridge , near kabul university , "" she recalls . "" the people where in such bad condition hundreds maybe more were there every single day . the police moved them on so now they ' re spread out all over the city . but nobody is there to think about their life and take care of them , so that ' s when i came up with idea to start mother camp .

"" nobody is helping people in my country , "" she says . "" everything is so wrong here . the government is corrupt , which means society is also corrupt . "" in another suburb , close to the slums of kabul , is a methadone clinic operated by medecins du monde ( doctors of the world ) . it ' s the only clinic in afghanistan that is allowed to dispense methadone a substitute for heroin . some 71 addicts registered on the program arrive each day to receive the methadone a liquid poured into a small paper cup and drunk once a day . program director ernst wisse says this is the best and most effective way to get drug addicts off heroin . it also eliminates the use of needles and dramatically reduces the risk of hiv spreading . "" what we fear is that this epidemic , we have a concentrated epidemic of hiv among the entire population . . . if this grows , and it will grow if you don ' t put any effective intervention into place , then automatically it will get out of hand and then there ' s nothing you can do , "" he says . two years ago , the afghan government allowed medecins du monde to expand the methadone program to 200 clients . several months later they shut it down , wisse says , claiming they hadn ' t decided if this was the best form of treatment . "" this decision means there are only 71 clients under methadone in the whole of afghanistan , "" explains wisse . "" the drug addiction problem in afghanistan is enormous and growing and unless they extend the program , the situation is only going to get worse . "" watch video : drug addiction rampant on kabul ' s streets in a small room at the back of a clinic is a bed for addicts who walk in off the street . the program has been able to take a new patient because one of the registered addicts came off methadone . wisse introduces me to 38 year old asadullah who has just arrived . he gets off the bed and shakes my hand a huge smile reveals his missing teeth . what teeth he does have are black and decaying . asadullah decided to come to the clinic after meeting the outreach team of medecins du monde . several times a week , the health workers visit areas around kabul where drug addicts live and hand out clean needles , sterile swabs and offer counseling . "" i know these people , they used to give me clean needles . they kept telling to come to the clinic and finally i did , "" he proudly explains . "" i feel better now , because the methadone is a replacement of the drug it gives us a better feeling . i want to use methadone until i forget about drugs completely and to find a good way to start a normal life again . "" asadullah has been using heroin for the past 14 years , supporting a habit of three grams a day , which costs about us 24 . but the father of four says his family has had enough , and has told him he has to get off drugs or they won ' t support him any longer . "" drugs are ruining my life . it ' s a bad thing in our society , "" he says . "" i also have got bad effects from drugs and my family has also been affected that ' s why i need to stop this . "" one man who now works at the clinic knows exactly what asadullah is going through . raheem , 48 , was one of the first patients to arrive at the clinic two and a half years ago . "" i ' d been using drugs for 17 years . i started when i was in a prison in iran , "" he says . "" during that time i faced a lot of problems and difficulties . i didn ' t have any information or contact with my family and that ' s when i started to use heroin . "" when i got out of prison someone told me methadone was coming to afghanistan and i wanted to get on the program . now i don ' t even use methadone .

"in a single week , the israeli army ' s chief of staff , the former head of internal security and the former head of external security have all publicly questioned israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu ' s judgment on iran . while the current army chief spoke narrowly about the iranian government , the former security officials directed their fire at israeli politicians . on friday , the former internal security chief told an israeli audience , "" i don ' t believe in a leadership that makes decisions based on messianic feelings "" and he was speaking not of iran , but of israel . last week was israel ' s independence day , traditionally an occasion of pride and celebration . instead , israelis are in a deep funk . at its founding in 1948 , israel seemed an improbable state . an ingathering of jews from eastern europe , the arab world and beyond had no real economy , no common language and no common idea of what it was to be an israeli . tensions between religious jews and secular jews , european jews and oriental jews , and jews and arabs simmered for decades . they made accommodations in the name of survival , but few conceded the fight for control of the state . to hear many israelis tell it now , their nation has become an impossible state . politics are more contentious than ever . the israeli welfare state is in full view , as the religious , the poor and the religious poor make increasing demands on the state . prices are skyrocketing , and the public feels squeezed . a diminishing number of israelis serve in the army , which once prided itself on universal conscription . although the old distinctions between polish and german jews have faded , many oriental jews continue to feel disenfranchised , the rising political prominence of recent immigrants from the former soviet union has created another tribe in israel , and the poor and disempowered ethiopian jews yet one more . politics in israel has always been a contact sport , but rather than battle to win over the center , an increasing number of political battles are conducted entirely on the fringes . small religious parties seek greater social spending for their constituents , while a party representing secular russian jews focuses on undermining a law exempting ultra orthodox israelis from military service . in election after election , the major parties ' share of the vote diminishes , leading to weak coalitions that are ideologically incoherent and that are forced to dole out cabinet posts and largesse to their members to stay in power . governments become tentative and fragile . the problems call for decisiveness , but the politicians rarely feel they can afford to be . for israelis , iran is an excruciating problem . they rely on intelligence that is never as good as they wish it to be , try to assess accurately actions of people they don ' t know well and do so with potentially devastating consequences for a wrong move . israelis also debate iran with a clarity few other countries can muster : if bombs fell on israel , how many people have access to fallout shelters ? are the disastrous forest fires of 2010 a sign that israel ' s disaster response is simply not up to the task of a military confrontation ? what would a military confrontation look like anyway , and could it be won ? israel ' s last war against another state ' s army was almost 40 years ago . its subsequent confrontations have had less clear results . the israeli political class struggles to consider these issues and more . should israel do more to seek peace with the palestinians ? can it reverse increasingly hostile relations with turkey ? is a wealth of recently discovered natural gas in the mediterranean the country ' s economic salvation ? can israel do anything about shifting politics in egypt and the rest of the arab world that are sidelining pragmatists who sought an accommodation with israel ? and more fundamentally , what is it to be a jewish state when israelis themselves cannot agree on who is the arbiter of jewishness ? none of these problems is especially new , but the political forces in israel seem increasingly unable to confront them . israelis have traditionally sought political salvation from former generals . many of israel ' s greatest political personalities , from yitzhak rabin to ariel sharon , came out of the military establishment . for more than a decade , former leaders on the security front have tried to step forward to consolidate israeli politics toward the middle . former gen . yitzhak mordechai formed the ill fated center party in 1999 , and sharon formed the centrist kadima party in 2005 . the security veterans ' recent critiques fit into the same pattern , and they may boost the political aspirations of newcomer yair lapid , whose background is in media rather than the battlefield . yet tactics communicated at high volume are not the same as strategy , and israelis increasingly complain that the former keep substituting for the latter . it is a sign of the vibrancy of israeli political life that authoritative voices can come out and critique government policy . it is a sign of the weakness of israeli politics that so many of israel ' s same problems persist and so many coalitions remain fragile . for many outside of israel , it is israel ' s position on iran that is truly consequential , and the rest is commentary . for israelis , the roiling debate on iran is just another example of the way israeli politics work . israeli politics are not likely to change quickly , and the challenges israelis feel from iran are not likely to go away quickly either . therein lies the rub . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of jon b . alterman .",1,single week  israeli army

"republican presidential candidates ( l r ) new jersey gov . chris christie , sen . marco rubio ( r fl ) , ben carson , wisconsin gov . scott walker , donald trump , jeb bush , mike huckabee , sen . ted cruz ( r tx ) , sen . rand paul ( r ky ) and john kasich take the stage for the first prime time presidential debate hosted by fox news and facebook at the quicken loans arena august 6 , 2015 in cleveland , ohio . the top ten gop candidates were selected to participate in the debate based on their rank in an average of the five most recent national political polls . des moines , iowa ( ap ) ? donald trump won t be onstage when republican presidential candidates make their final appeals to iowa voters in thursday night s debate , and that gives the rest of the field a rare opportunity to frame the election in their own terms , at least for one night . trump is boycotting the debate in a dispute with host fox news . instead , he is holding a competing rally a few miles away that is likely to draw significant attention ? as well as the participation of some lower polling candidates hoping to draft off the front runner s success . even with trump s shadow hanging over the debate , his closest competitors are eager for an opportunity to break through in his absence . they also hope his boycott will be viewed negatively by voters in iowa , which kicks off voting in the 2016 presidential race next monday . i think it ll hurt him that he s not showing up in the iowa debate four days before the iowa caucuses , former florida gov . jeb bush told cnn . florida sen . marco rubio said republicans don t have time for these kinds of distractions . trump has led the republican race nationally for months , to the surprise of many . in iowa , however , polls suggest he s locked in a tight race with texas sen . ted cruz , a favorite of the conservatives and evangelical christians who hold significant sway in the state s republican caucuses . some campaigns were preparing for the possibility trump could reverse course and take the stage in des moines after all . however , he moved forward with plans to host a rally a few miles away that his campaign said would raise money for wounded warriors . on thursday , he announced the launch of a new website for collecting donations to veterans ahead of the event . the link , which he posted on twitter , includes the seal of the donald j . trump foundation , and a form for contributions . mike huckabee and rick santorum , iowa caucus winners in the past who have struggled to gain traction in the 2016 campaign , planned to join trump at the event after appearing in an earlier undercard debate . they were relegated to that secondary contest because of low poll numbers . with fox carrying the main debate , other cable channels were likely to show trump s event , stealing away at least some viewers who would have otherwise watched the contest . i think it s typical trump , said don kass , chairman of iowa s plymouth county gop . he s betting on him making a bigger splash . while earlier debates have been instrumental in the rise and fall of several gop candidates , they have had minimal apparent impact on trump s standing . he s preferred to make his case to potential voters in national television interviews and on twitter , and has sometimes played a less forceful role in the debates . trump s absence was likely to turn attention to cruz , a firebrand conservative disdained by many in his party , and rubio , who is hoping a third place finish in iowa could help him establish him as the choice of more traditional republicans . others on the debate stage will have their eyes on new hampshire , where they re hoping a strong showing in the feb . 9 primary will jumpstart their white house hopes . bush , ohio gov . john kasich and new jersey gov . chris christie have all devoted the bulk of their campaign resources to new hampshire . also on the main debate stage thursday : retired neurosurgeon ben carson , who has a loyal following in iowa , and kentucky sen . rand paul , who was relegated to the undercard in the last debate . iowa s fast food workers , meanwhile , hoped to draw at least 1 , 000 low wage workers to rally for change outside thursday s debate venue . trump s fox feud dates back to the first republican primary debate , when moderator megyn kelly took the billionaire business mogul to task over derogatory statements he d made toward women . trump had threatened to boycott thursday s debate if fox stuck with plans for kelly to moderate again but later said it was a sarcastic statement from the network that was the final straw . that statement said the leaders of iran and russia both intend to treat donald trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president and that trump has his own secret plan to replace the cabinet with his twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings .",1,republican

' a lot of people with the commonwealth games were saying ' usa aren ' t there , china aren ' t there ' . ' it didn ' t matter , because the times they were posting rivalled the rest of the world , so it ' s going to be interesting going into the world championships next year and see how good these guys can be . ' they aren ' t fazed who they stand up next to any more . they ' re all their to be beaten . adlington won two bronze medals at the london olympics to add to the two golds she won in beijing ' everyone in the pool has that attitude which is absolutely incredible . ' the strength in depth is best illustrated in the men ' s breaststroke events , where pre race favourite and london 2012 silver medallist michael jamieson was beaten to commonwealth 200metres gold by fellow scot ross murdoch . adam peaty , the commonwealth and european 100m champion , andrew willis and others are also ensuring competition is tight . adlington added : ' the depth is fantastic . men ' s breaststroke is just insane . only two people can go to the world championships . ' when you ' ve got four guys in the top 10 in the world fighting for two places , they ' re going to have to be on form and on target . british swimmers performed well at the glasgow commonwealth games both in terms of medals and times ' they can ' t relax at the trials , which can only be good . ' that ' s what you ' ve got to do at the world championships . you ' ve got to step up in the heats and semi finals and post pbs ( personal best times ) just to make it through . ' while enthusiastic about the improvement in british swimming , adlington does not yearn for a return to the water . ' i don ' t miss the competition element , ' she added . ' i try to go in the pool as much as i can . it ' s such a nice way to relax . it ' s a nice way to think about your day and problem solve . it ' s a nice time to get 30 minutes to yourself thinking , as well as doing something productive .

"labour ' s key pledge to spend an extra 2 . 5billion a year on the nhs was in tatters last night , after it emerged that the money would not start trickling into nhs coffers until the middle of the next parliament . ed miliband used his main conference speech two weeks ago to announce a mansion tax , the proceeds of which would go towards the health service . the 2 . 5billion time to care fund would be paid for by a mansion tax , a levy on tobacco firms and a tax avoidance crackdown all of which would need legislation before the money could be spent . the labour leader said his plan would help transform the nhs . mr miliband did not , however , mention that the policy would take time to phase in and would not produce the 2 . 5billion until 2017 18 , depriving the health service of the money in the meantime . sources close to shadow chancellor ed balls told the guardian that none of the money would be available in the first year and only an unspecified amount would be available in the second year , because the party would need to steer a budget through parliament before the taxes could be spent on the nhs . last night , conservative and lib dem mps accused labour of deceit and ' hypocritical posturing ' over an issue ed miliband hopes will help win the general election in may . health secretary jeremy hunt said : ' the centrepiece of labour ' s conference now lies in tatters . we have consistently said that the measures ed miliband set out wouldn ' t raise anything like what he promised .

"the shifting sands of the premier league moved yet again on transfer deadline day as the big six opted to stick while those below them continued to spend and flex their new found muscles . for fans of arsenal , manchester united , liverpool , manchester city and even chelsea and tottenham , it was a quiet 24 hours with not a single player brought in and instead the likes of stoke city and everton showed why the difference between the bottom four and top four is closing at a rate never seen before . this is a season that has already seen clubs as small as bournemouth sign the kind of players only available to the premier league elite in days gone by and on deadline day it was stoke who spent the most , paying nearly ? 24m , a club record , for defensive midfielder giannelli imbula from porto . this deal comes on top of previous scoops for high profile signings such as xherdan shaqiri , ibrahim affelay and bojan , all players you could never have envisaged arriving in the potteries before the latest television deal changed the financial environment of every club in the top flight . ? stoke city fc ( stokecity ) february 1 , 2016 stoke manager mark hughes said : i m delighted . it s been a long day but we ve got a very , very good young player who has a lot of potential still to realise . stoke were also able to turn down a big money offer from leicester for striker mame biram diouf while the shock premier league leaders , despite failing in a ? 20m bid for cska moscow striker ahmed musa , had no problems keeping jamie vardy or riyad mahrez out of the hands of their many admirers at bigger clubs . there was an interesting contrast on merseyside , too , where liverpool ? used to being the big spenders ? found their money wasn t enough to tempt shakhar dontesk into selling alex teixeira , while everton spent ? 18m on striker oumar niasse from lokomotiv moscow to partner romelu lukaku . niasse has 12 goals and 12 asists in russia already this season and his arrival delighted everton manager roberto martinez who said : oumar is a player we have been following for a long time . he is the right personality and someone who is in a very good moment of his career . he has had a lot of success in russia and he brings a different quality to what we already have in our squad . the new era also appears to have given smaller clubs greater belief in their ability to turn down offers for their best players . southampton , for instance , were able to make it very clear they would not sell sadio mane or victor wanyama despite being linked with clubs the size of manchester united and tottenham . west brom followed that pattern on deadline day with a staunch refusal to accept even a ? 24m offer from newcastle for striker saido berahino ? a stance that fascinated republic legend niall quinn . some people will say it s a breath of fresh air , said quinn . the player is probably itching for the move and probably confused by it all . we ve seen him go wobbly before when he had a move taken away from him . but what we ve seen is that jeremy peace at west brom won t be messed around by berahino , his agent or his advisors . berahino was the story of last year s transfer deadline day of course ? and he put his name in the headlines once again with yet another inadvisable tweet as his chances of a move appeared to fall through . everyone waiting once again for the silly little spoilt boy to make same mistake so here you go . everyone waiting once again for the silly little spoilt boy to make the same mistake , so here you go , he said . goodnight all and thanks for the support . at arsenal , despite possibly their best ever opportunity to break their premier league title drought this season , there was no sign of a player coming as matthieu debuchy left on a loan deal to bordeaux and yaya sanogo moved to charlton . totttenham also failed to do business while chelsea opted not to allow loic remy to leave on loan and manchester united remained deadly quiet despite their frustrating campaign . however newcastle boosted their chances of avoiding relegation by adding striker seydou doumbia from roma on loan , having already bought andros townsend from spurs , and the television money appears to be making its way down to the championship where middlesbrough paid ? 14m for blackburn striker jordan rhodes . one club unable to make any kind of impact in the market , however , was aston villa ? a situation that disapointed manager remi garde so much that reports are already surfacing which suggest the frenchman may consider his position at villa park . i remember when i was at sunderland , randy lerner came to us and paid ? 24m for darren bent to keep them off the bottom . now the rewards to stay in the league are even greater and i m a little bit perplexed they haven t tried to have a go . it s very strange . i m sure the fans will be furious . it will be seen as a white flag of surrender . remi garde is entitled to question it . he was obviously made promises that weren t delivered . at a broader level , the big question raised by window is this : are the big boys saving their money for the summer window ? or is the market changing for good ?",1,shifting sands premier league moved yet transfer deadline day big six opted stick continued spend flex new found muscles  fans arsenal  manchester united  liverpool  manchester city even chelsea tottenham  quiet 24 hours single player brought instead likes stoke city everton showed difference bottom four top four closing rate never seen  season already seen clubs small bournemouth sign kind players available premier league elite days gone deadline day stoke spent  paying nearly  24m  club record  defensive midfielder giannelli imbula porto  deal comes top previous scoops high profile signings xherdan shaqiri  ibrahim affelay bojan  players could never envisaged arriving potteries latest television deal changed financial environment every club top flight   stoke city fc  stokecity  february 1  2016 stoke manager mark hughes said  delighted  long day got  good young player lot potential still realise  stoke also able turn big money offer leicester striker mame biram diouf shock premier league leaders  despite failing  20m bid cska moscow striker ahmed musa  problems keeping jamie vardy riyad mahrez hands many admirers bigger clubs  interesting contrast merseyside   liverpool  used big spenders  found money enough tempt shakhar dontesk selling alex teixeira  everton spent  18m striker oumar niasse lokomotiv moscow partner romelu lukaku  niasse 12 goals 12 asists russia already season arrival delighted everton manager roberto martinez said  oumar player following long time  right personality someone good moment career  lot success russia brings different quality already squad  new era also appears given smaller clubs greater belief ability turn offers best players  southampton  instance  able make clear would sell sadio mane victor wanyama despite linked clubs size manchester united tottenham  west brom followed pattern deadline day staunch refusal accept even  24m offer newcastle striker saido berahino  stance fascinated republic legend niall quinn  people say breath fresh air  said quinn  player probably itching move probably confused  seen go wobbly move taken away  seen jeremy peace west brom messed around berahino  agent advisors  berahino story last year transfer deadline day course  put name headlines yet another inadvisable tweet chances move appeared fall  everyone waiting silly little spoilt boy make mistake go  everyone waiting silly little spoilt boy make mistake  go  said  goodnight thanks support  arsenal  despite possibly best ever opportunity break premier league title drought season  sign player coming matthieu debuchy left loan deal bordeaux yaya sanogo moved charlton  totttenham also failed business chelsea opted allow loic remy leave loan manchester united remained deadly quiet despite frustrating campaign  however newcastle boosted chances avoiding relegation adding striker seydou doumbia roma loan  already bought andros townsend spurs  television money appears making way championship middlesbrough paid  14m blackburn striker jordan rhodes  one club unable make kind impact market  however  aston villa  situation disapointed manager remi garde much reports already surfacing suggest frenchman may consider position villa park  remember sunderland  randy lerner came us paid  24m darren bent keep bottom  rewards stay league even greater little bit perplexed tried go  strange  sure fans furious  seen white flag surrender  remi garde entitled question  obviously made promises delivered  broader level  big question raised window  big boys saving money summer window  market changing good ,sports

"the pm should beware careless talk about 70 , 000 anti isil ground troops that may well not materialise is fighters on top of a military vehicle with anti aircraft guns ? photo : raqqa media center ap if , as now seems likely , david cameron wins parliamentary approval for joining coalition air strikes against islamic state ( isil ) positions in syria , finding sufficient numbers of raf tornados will be the least of his worries . having spent the past five years overseeing drastic cuts to the size and strength of our armed forces , the government should hardly be surprised to find itself scratching around in search of serviceable warplanes for syria . dr julian lewis , the chairman of the defence select committee , reckons that , assuming mr cameron does win the vote , britain would only be able to add another two to four tornados to the eight strong force the raf is already operating from cyprus against isil targets in iraq . it is hardly the kind of response that will have isil s barbarians quaking in their boots . but at least it means that britain can now retake its place at the top table and work with its allies to eradicate the islamic state menace . as mr cameron would be the first to admit , however , bombing these positions per se is only likely to make a limited contribution to the broader coalition objective of destroying isil . to achieve that goal the general consensus , among politicians and military folk alike , is that ground forces will be required . and that is the one area where , before today s all day commons debate has even begun , the achilles heel in the prime minister s argument in favour of military action in syria has started to appear . it is now generally accepted that , during the build up to the iraq war in 2003 , tony blair s biggest mistake was to rely so heavily on the wmd issue to justify the overthrow of saddam hussein . when the wmds failed to materialise , the left gleefully seized on the topic to pillory mr blair and claim the entire campaign had been undertaken on a falsehood . so far as today s syria vote is concerned , the constant bickering over jeremy corbyn s leadership means the left has become an incoherent rabble . while ken livingstone witters on about deploying chinese and brazilian peacekeepers to tackle isil ? has anyone on copacabana even heard of them  his allies on the left are so bereft of informed argument that they have been reduced to good , old fashioned scaremongering , telling mps that they will be responsible for killing babies if they back air strikes . "" if he is not careful , mr cameron s pledge to have found 70 , 000 syrian fighters will turn out to be nothing more than a phantom army . "" lame and offensive remarks like this are unlikely to make much headway , particularly as mps on all sides of the house now seem to have satisfied themselves as to the rationale for extending british military operations from iraq into neighbouring syria . but even if the left have lost this particular argument , that does not mean to say they have given up , and determined opponents of military action will be looking for any and every opportunity to claim that mr cameron , like mr blair before him , has taken britain to war on a false pretext . within that context , mr cameron needs to tread with some care when he claims , as he did in the commons last week when setting out the government s case for military intervention in syria , that , when it comes to using ground forces to defeat isil , there are 70 , 000 syrian opposition fighters we can work with . the reason , of course , that we must rely on local proxies to do our dirty work is that , while the british army is still capable of mustering a fighting force , no one in whitehall wants to use it . consequently , this means the government is desperate to find pro western syrian fighters to do the job on our behalf . the big problem , though , with mr cameron s claim that he has found 70 , 000 willing opposition fighters to take on isil is that , in his keenness to satisfy his critics that he has thought through all the options , he has glossed over the reality of the war on the ground in syria , where there are an estimated 100 or more opposition groups all pursuing their own agendas . mr cameron s stated preference is to work with the moderate free syrian army ( fsa ) , which is primarily comprised of former members of the syrian military . but mr cameron s hopes that they can be relied upon to defeat isil on the ground overlook the fact the fsa is mainly based in southern syria , hundreds of miles from isil s raqqa headquarters in the north . fsa commanders are also said to still be disaffected over the fiasco two years ago when western powers ? including britain ? threatened to bomb the assad regime for using chemical weapons against its own citizens , but then failed to follow through . members of al nusra front ride a tank as they head towards their positions during an offensive to take control of the northwestern city of ariha ? photo : reuters and , in the absence of the fsa , the options are extremely limited , as most of the other effective anti isil groups , such as the al nusra front , are manned by irreconcilable islamists ? not the sort of people the west wants to see in power in damascus if and when the assad regime is removed . thus , if he is not careful , mr cameron s pledge to have found 70 , 000 syrian fighters will turn out to be nothing more than a phantom army . and then the left really will have a field day destroying his political reputation over another unpopular war in the middle east .",1,pm beware careless talk 70  000 anti isil ground troops may well materialise fighters top military vehicle anti aircraft guns  photo  raqqa media center ap  seems likely  david cameron wins parliamentary approval joining coalition air strikes islamic state  isil  positions syria  finding sufficient numbers raf tornados least worries  spent past five years overseeing drastic cuts size strength armed forces  government hardly surprised find scratching around search serviceable warplanes syria  dr julian lewis  chairman defence select committee  reckons  assuming mr cameron win vote  britain would able add another two four tornados eight strong force raf already operating cyprus isil targets iraq  hardly kind response isil barbarians quaking boots  least means britain retake place top table work allies eradicate islamic state menace  mr cameron would first admit  however  bombing positions per se likely make limited contribution broader coalition objective destroying isil  achieve goal general consensus  among politicians military folk alike  ground forces required  one area  today day commons debate even begun  achilles heel prime minister argument favour military action syria started appear  generally accepted  build iraq war 2003  tony blair biggest mistake rely heavily wmd issue justify overthrow saddam hussein  wmds failed materialise  left gleefully seized topic pillory mr blair claim entire campaign undertaken falsehood  far today syria vote concerned  constant bickering jeremy corbyn leadership means left become incoherent rabble  ken livingstone witters deploying chinese brazilian peacekeepers tackle isil  anyone copacabana even heard allies left bereft informed argument reduced good  old fashioned scaremongering  telling mps responsible killing babies back air strikes   careful  mr cameron pledge found 70  000 syrian fighters turn nothing phantom army   lame offensive remarks like unlikely make much headway  particularly mps sides house seem satisfied rationale extending british military operations iraq neighbouring syria  even left lost particular argument  mean say given  determined opponents military action looking every opportunity claim mr cameron  like mr blair  taken britain war false pretext  within context  mr cameron needs tread care claims  commons last week setting government case military intervention syria   comes using ground forces defeat isil  70  000 syrian opposition fighters work  reason  course  must rely local proxies dirty work  british army still capable mustering fighting force  one whitehall wants use  consequently  means government desperate find pro western syrian fighters job behalf  big problem  though  mr cameron claim found 70  000 willing opposition fighters take isil  keenness satisfy critics thought options  glossed reality war ground syria  estimated 100 opposition groups pursuing agendas  mr cameron stated preference work moderate free syrian army  fsa   primarily comprised former members syrian military  mr cameron hopes relied upon defeat isil ground overlook fact fsa mainly based southern syria  hundreds miles isil raqqa headquarters north  fsa commanders also said still disaffected fiasco two years ago western powers  including britain  threatened bomb assad regime using chemical weapons citizens  failed follow  members al nusra front ride tank head towards positions offensive take control northwestern city ariha  photo  reuters  absence fsa  options extremely limited  effective anti isil groups  al nusra front  manned irreconcilable islamists  sort people west wants see power damascus assad regime removed  thus  careful  mr cameron pledge found 70  000 syrian fighters turn nothing phantom army  left really field day destroying political reputation another unpopular war middle east ,fight
"talks between representatives of the douglas park , george taylor and george letham consortium and the ibrox board are ongoing as the club seeks a short term solution to an increasingly drastic financial situation . with american financier robert sarver who revealed that he had not wanted lewis macleod or any other rangers player sold as a condition of his offer now apparently out of the running after the board ' s rejection of his improved 20million bid , the three bears appear to be the only show in town . the future of glasgow rangers remains uncertain due to the club ' s drastic financial situation rangers ace nicky law celebrates after putting his side ahead against alloa in their last league game they are prepared to offer 6 . 5m in emergency funding , which would keep the club solvent until the end of the season , with that loan being converted into equity at the forthcoming share issue . aware of the fact newcastle owner mike ashley has two men on the board after lending the club 3m , the park led consortium are adamant they should have no less than that number for an investment of more than twice that amount . sportsmail understands it is the board ' s insistence in allowing only one of the group to join them that is holding up the deal and increasing the chances the club will not be able to meet its payroll obligations a week on thursday . given the sway ashley has at the club with just 8 . 92 per cent of the shares , it is likely the park group are seeking the removal of chief executive derek llambias and finance director barry leach . embattled chairman david somers seems a likely sacrificial lamb but whether his head along with one of ashley ' s crew would satisfy the would be saviours remains to be seen . newcastle owner mike ashley has two members on the rangers board following a loan 3million negotiations between both parties are ongoing but the lingering possibility that dave king could yet call an extraordinary general meeting seeking boardroom change is a threat to the talks . king ' s scheme to have season ticket money paid into a trust fund last summer put him on a war footing with the board . their reluctance to deal with him means he is being pushed towards calling for an egm in order to get the personnel changes he desires . not only could this take up to 42 days , it would potentially pull the rug from under the group seeking to achieve such goals by more conventional methods . although the impasse means the club are fast running out of money , they yesterday closed the door on the possibility of being financed and taken over by arizona suns owner sarver . sarver had upped an original 18m bid to 20m last week on the proviso that fresh share capital would be issued to him . but on monday the board again rejected his proposal on the basis it was unlikely to secure the 75 per cent shareholder support for such equity to be offered to a non shareholder . the ibrox club have turned down a 20million bid by us financier robert sarver in rejecting sarver ' s latest offer , a rangers statement to the stock exchange emphasised the same problems it raised with the first offer . ' the revised proposal by mr sarver was similar to his first proposal in the respect that it sought a placing of 100 million shares ( to be priced at 20p in this proposal ) which would require the approval of shareholders ( at least a 75 per cent majority ) at a general meeting , ' it said . ' the board of rangers rejected the first proposal from mr sarver on january 6 on the basis that the board felt it unlikely that the approval of shareholders holding sufficient shares would be forthcoming . ' a survey of the views of ' a number of major shareholders ' on the revised proposal had suggested it , too , was unlikely to receive the backing required , the club added . as part of sarver ' s 20m offer , he was willing to hand the club an emergency 6 . 5m loan to help alleviate their cash flow problems . responding to the latest rejection , sarver first released a statement to the stock exchange before commenting on the situation . only agreeing to a compromise on board members will allow the three bears plan to take flight a statement on his behalf read : ' it was announced by rangers this morning that the board of the company had rejected the revised proposal on the basis that they felt it unlikely that the approval of shareholders holding sufficient shares would be forthcoming , and that therefore the board did not intend to hold the general meeting that would be necessary to implement the proposal . the board did not make any counter proposal . ' robert sarver today announces that as a result of the board ' s failure to provide a counter proposal or to engage in any meaningful negotiations with him , he does not now intend to make an offer for rangers .

"roy and jenny davies pulled son alistair , 14 , and daughter rhiannon , 13 , out of school for a week so they could enjoy some much needed ' quality time ' . the holiday followed a stressful year in which a family member died and mrs davies underwent emergency surgery which left her unable to walk . while the family deemed their circumstances ' exceptional ' , alistair ' s school did not agree , fining the parents 60 . roy and jenny davies were fined 240 for taking their children alistair , 14 , and rhiannon , 13 , out of school for a holiday to corfu after a ' traumatic year ' mr and mrs davies , from cheddar , refused to pay , leading somerset county council to prosecute the pair . magistrates in taunton , somerset , said they ' sympathised ' with the couple but imposed a fine of 240 plus costs a total of 290 . the true cost is likely to be far higher , with self employed welder mr davies missing out on an estimated further 300 from two full days of work spent in court thanks to their original hearing being adjourned . the couple say they are furious at the way they have been treated by alistair ' s school kings of wessex academy , in cheddar particularly as rhiannon ' s school took no action over her absence . they decided to take the holiday after a traumatic 15 months . three days after the funeral of mr davies ' father , mrs davies was rushed to hospital with a cyst on one of her ovaries . an operation to remove it forced the mother of two to stop working as she spent 10 months on heavy painkillers before having a further operation on her toe because of arthritis . alistair ' s school imposed a fine on the davies family for taking the holiday , which came after a death in the family and mrs davies undergoing emergency surgery mr davies said : ' we needed quality time as a family as the children had a very dramatic 18 months . the children spent their summer holidays running around and fetching things for their mum . ' if we had been worried about their education , we would not have taken them out of school . ' as a result of the crackdown on term time absences imposed by former education secretary michael gove in september 2013 , headteachers can no longer grant up to 10 days ' holiday a year . instead , they can allow leave only in ' exceptional circumstances ' each parent who ignores a ban faces a 60 fine per child , rising to 120 if it is not paid within 21 days . failure to pay the fine can result in prosecution , with a maximum fine if convicted of 2 , 500 or a jail sentence of up to three months . the move was intended to stop families damaging their children ' s education by taking them away when holiday firms offer cheaper holidays . a quarter of primary schools have punished parents for ignoring bans . the couple booked a holiday to corfu for october last year , which involved taking the children out of school for a week . mrs davies , 47 , said : ' we wanted to take the holiday with the half term holidays , but it doubles in price . it ' s crazy . ' rhiannon ' s school , fairlands middle school in cheddar , raised no objection but alistair ' s school warned they could face a fine . alistair has good grades so the family thought his absence would not affect his long term prospects . mrs davies said : ' my son was getting so stressed out on the holiday , worrying that he ' d have so much work to catch up on . ' i told him we ' d figure it out together . but he didn ' t get any extra homework or any work to help him to catch up . ' when they returned home they were each slapped with 60 fines , which doubled to 120 each when they failed to pay within 21 days . last week they appeared in the dock at taunton magistrates ' court in somerset , where they both pleaded guilty . mr davies , 42 , showed the court letters and postcards praising alistair for his grades and hard work at the school . magistrate charis cavaghan pack said she ' sympathised ' with the family but it ' would not be in the interest of justice ' to let them off . alistair ' s school kings of wessex academy imposed a 60 fine on the parents , who refused to pay rhiannon ' s school fairlands middle school accepted the family ' s exceptional circumstances and allowed the 13 year old to have a week off they were fined 240 120 per adult per child per week of absence plus 30 costs and a 20 victim surcharge . after the hearing , mrs davies said : ' we think there were exceptional circumstances and while the school argued that it affected alistair ' s grades , we proved it wasn ' t the case with several postcards and letters from the school . ' the court hasn ' t taken into consideration that roy has lost two days of work as a self employed welder and fabricator and work has been quiet the last few months . it ' s difficult . ' a spokesman for somerset county council defended the decision to bring the case to court . ' when a case like this ends up in court it is the bench who decides on a verdict and appropriate sentence after considering all the evidence and any mitigating circumstances . ' we believe every child deserves the very best education and this is why we work closely with schools on attendance which in a small number of cases results in penalty notices being issued . ' neither school was available for comment this afternoon . parents have campaigned for holiday prices to be slashed now legislation stops families from taking time off during term time . more than 170 , 000 people have signed a petition calling on the government to force holiday companies to cut their prices , meaning it could be debated in parliament . as many as two fifths of parents would flout the rules so they can get a cheaper summer holiday , a poll found last year . one frustrated father paul cookson , 41 , was inspired to speak out after trying to book a trip to center parcs with his seven year old daughter phoebe . his facebook rant about perceived ' rip off ' prices went viral , with outraged parents sharing the post more than 143 , 000 times . ' i think i ' ve touched a nerve with this one , ' he said . ' i don ' t see why i should be penalised for sticking to the rules . ' martin dalby , from centre parcs , said : ' what we are doing is flexible pricing , ' he says . ' in the summer i could sell the place twice over and the prices reflect the high level of demand .

"voters legalized marijuana in 2012 on the understanding that revenue raised would go to schools , but a 1992 voter approved constitutional amendment means some of the 50 million gathered in taxes in the first year of legalized pot must be given to taxpayers as a rebate . the amendment requires colorado to pay back taxpayers when the state collects more than what ' s permitted by a formula based on inflation and population growth . over the years , colorado has issued refunds six times , totaling more than 3 . 3 billion . colorado has generated so much money from recreational pot taxes that the state is bound by law to pass some of the tax money directly on to residents for once republicans and democrats are united and say there ' s no good reason to put pot taxes back into people ' s pockets , and now state officials are scrambling to figure out how to avoid doling out the money . it may have to be settled by asking colorado voters , for a third time , to cast a ballot on the issue and exempt pot taxes from the refund requirement . republicans concede that marijuana is throwing them off their usual position of wanting tax dollars returned to taxpayers . but they also tend to say that marijuana should pay for itself that general taxes shouldn ' t pay for things like increased drug education and better training for police officers to identify stoned drivers . ' i think it ' s appropriate that we keep the money for marijuana that the voters said that we should , ' said republican senate president bill cadman . his party opposes keeping other refunds based on the taxpayers ' bill of rights but favors a special ballot question on pot taxes . ' this is a little bit of a different animal . there ' s a struggle on this one , ' said sen . kevin grantham , one of the republican budget writers . a 1992 voter approved constitutional amendment means some of the 50 million gathered in taxes in the first year of legalized pot must be given to taxpayers as a rebate after legalizing marijuana in 2012 , colorado voters returned to the polls the following year and approved a 15 percent excise tax on pot for the schools and an additional 10 percent sales tax for lawmakers to spend . voters were told those taxes would generate about 70 million in the first year . the state now believes it will rake in about 50 million . but because the economy is improving and other tax collections are growing faster , colorado is obligated to give back much of what it has collected . final numbers aren ' t ready , but the governor ' s budget writers predict the pot refunds could amount to 30 . 5 million , or about 7 . 63 per adult in colorado .

"david goffin ( bel ) ? beat kyle edmund ( gbr ) ? 3 6 , 1 6 , 6 2 , 6 1 , 6 0 kyle edmund reacts after suffering a five set loss to david goffin in the davis cup final getty images for the best part of an hour and a half it seemed too good to be true ? and so it proved to be . when kyle edmund , the world no 100 , won the first two sets here today against david goffin , the world no 16 and belgium s best hope of success in this davis cup final , the 20 year old briton appeared to be on the brink of one of the most sensational debuts in the competition s 115 year history . within another 90 minutes , however , edmund s day ended in tears as goffin won a match from two sets down for the first time in his career . edmund , who had played five sets on only one previous occasion in his career , blamed his 3 6 , 1 6 , 6 2 , 6 1 , 6 0 defeat , after two and three quarter hours , on tiredness and cramp . however , his physical issues were probably as much a manifestation of the mental pressures he was under . david goffin celebrates victory over kyle edmund in the davis cup final for a player who has only ever won two tour level matches and has spent most of this year competing in front of sparse crowds on the challenger tour , this was quite an introduction to the world s biggest annual team competition in any sport . since the abolition of the davis cup s challenge round , only five other players have made their debut in the final ? and none has won a match . my legs just started to get tired , edmund said . i could just feel them straining a bit . my legs started cramping a bit . i just lost a bit of confidence in my movement . pushing off every time i was serving and landing , it was just getting really tight . obviously it affects your mind . he added : in the third set he started to get on top of me . then things started to fall away . in the fourth and fifth sets i was struggling physically . it was just disappointing that my body couldn t hold up the way i would have liked it to . for the first two sets , nevertheless , edmund had done a superb job of keeping his nerves in check and focusing on the task in hand . after saving two break points in an opening game that lasted 12 minutes , he quickly settled into a beautiful rhythm , ? hitting his forehands , in particular , with enormous power and striking huge winners from the back of the court . to rapturous , if incredulous , cheers from the british supporters , edmund raced into a 5 0 lead , had a point to win the first set 6 0 and then held his nerve when goffin fought back to 5 3 . after ? closing out the first set with an ace , he took the second even more convincingly , winning six games in a row . kyle edmund is congratulated by great britain captain leon smith goffin , who had appeared particularly nervous at the start , was enduring an ear bashing from his captain , johan van herck , at every changeover and looked as if this was the last place in the world that he wanted to be . however , just when he appeared to be melting away as quickly as a ? belgian chocolate in an oven , ? he suddenly rediscovered ? his form . two breaks of serve saw goffin go 4 1 up in the third set , and although edmund broke back in the next game that was effectively his last significant contribution . as goffin struck the ball with the sweet timing that is usually one of his trademarks , edmund started to move much less freely and his game grew increasingly ragged . ? after goffin won 14 of the last 15 games , the belgians celebrated in appropriate fashion as a tearful edmund sat slumped in his chair with his head under a towel . kyle edmund ' s team mates cheer him on during his davis cup match against david goffin i was very upset , edmund said . you re doing something you love , it s your job , it s something you do every day , you put a lot of time and effort into it , so you take it very seriously and you become emotionally attached to it . i was dominating the first two sets . he couldn t get near me . he turned that , and that s something i need to learn from . obviously i m disappointed that i couldn t do it for the team , but i think it s one of the most important experiences i ll have . goffin said that edmund had played an unbelievable first two sets but added : i knew it s always tough when you are young , when you re playing your first match in davis cup , to play three sets like this . it s always tough . that s why i tried to stay calm and waited for my chance .",1,david goffin  bel   beat kyle edmund  gbr   3 6  1 6  6 2  6 1  6 0 kyle edmund reacts suffering five set loss david goffin davis cup final getty images best part hour half seemed good true  proved  kyle edmund  world 100  first two sets today david goffin  world 16 belgium best hope success davis cup final  20 year old briton appeared brink one sensational debuts competition 115 year history  within another 90 minutes  however  edmund day ended tears goffin match two sets first time career  edmund  played five sets one previous occasion career  blamed 3 6  1 6  6 2  6 1  6 0 defeat  two three quarter hours  tiredness cramp  however  physical issues probably much manifestation mental pressures  david goffin celebrates victory kyle edmund davis cup final player ever two tour level matches spent year competing front sparse crowds challenger tour  quite introduction world biggest annual team competition sport  since abolition davis cup challenge round  five players made debut final  none match  legs started get tired  edmund said  could feel straining bit  legs started cramping bit  lost bit confidence movement  pushing every time serving landing  getting really tight  obviously affects mind  added  third set started get top  things started fall away  fourth fifth sets struggling physically  disappointing body hold way would liked  first two sets  nevertheless  edmund done superb job keeping nerves check focusing task hand  saving two break points opening game lasted 12 minutes  quickly settled beautiful rhythm   hitting forehands  particular  enormous power striking huge winners back court  rapturous  incredulous  cheers british supporters  edmund raced 5 0 lead  point win first set 6 0 held nerve goffin fought back 5 3   closing first set ace  took second even convincingly  winning six games row  kyle edmund congratulated great britain captain leon smith goffin  appeared particularly nervous start  enduring ear bashing captain  johan van herck  every changeover looked last place world wanted  however  appeared melting away quickly  belgian chocolate oven   suddenly rediscovered  form  two breaks serve saw goffin go 4 1 third set  although edmund broke back next game effectively last significant contribution  goffin struck ball sweet timing usually one trademarks  edmund started move much less freely game grew increasingly ragged   goffin 14 last 15 games  belgians celebrated appropriate fashion tearful edmund sat slumped chair head towel  kyle edmund  team mates cheer davis cup match david goffin upset  edmund said  something love  job  something every day  put lot time effort  take seriously become emotionally attached  dominating first two sets  get near  turned  something need learn  obviously disappointed team  think one important experiences  goffin said edmund played unbelievable first two sets added  knew always tough young  playing first match davis cup  play three sets like  always tough  tried stay calm waited chance ,sports

"so what ' s new ? the cast may have changed but the script is expected to remain the same . inter milan may have swapped coach jose mourinho for spain ' s rafa benitez but the club is still expected to win its sixth straight title . inter ' s 3 1 win over nearest rivals roma in the super cup only served to underline the club ' s superiority over its serie a rivals . the season ' s curtain raiser is usually played between the serie a and italian cup winners but with inter winning both , roma took part simply because they were runners up in both competitions . the fact that ranieri ' s charges were dispatched again meant that nerazzurri picked up their fourth trophy of 2010 . number five could well be a formality . it ' s been a relatively quiet close season for the serie a and european champions league holders with the 35 million sale of mario balotelli to manchester city being the biggest news . replacing him , however , is the exciting 18 year old attacker brazilian philippe coutinho who inter bought in 2008 and have had parked at vasco de gama ever since . if inter do find themselves short of a striker , benitez will have to resist casting envious glances at rivals roma who have secured the signature of old boy adriano to replace the genoa bound luca toni . known as "" the emperor "" during his pomp , the brazilian scored 48 goals in 123 games for inter and has been brought in by claudio ranieri to play in an attacking trident with francesco totti and mirko vucinic . in a bid to revive their fortunes , the two other giants of italian football ac milan and juventus have installed new coaches . il rossoneri may have been placed third last year but 10 points behind second placed roma was nothing to crow about . leonardo has since been ejected in favor of massimiliano allegri . allegri has won coach of the year for the last two terms a magnificent achievement considering he has been at the helm of lowly cagliari . in a further bid to revive their fortunes , the club are looking to bring in former inter striker zlatan ibrahimovic from barcelona . meanwhile , seventh placed juventus have drafted in luigi delneri who is fresh from securing a spot in the champions league qualifiers with sampdoria . the old lady has also boosted its chances by signing attacking midfielder alberto aquilani from liverpool and milos krasic of cska moscow . of the new boys , lecce are the only club with any real top flight experience having bounced between serie a and b for the last 25 years . promoted as champions they are expected to stand a better chance of retaining their place among italy ' s elite than cesena and brescia who achieved promotion by finishing second and via the playoffs respectively . key players : there are few players who enjoyed a better time last year than inter milan ' s dutch playmaker wesley sneijder . the 15 million euro signing from real madrid won the champions league and domestic double with inter last season and was awarded the silver ball and bronze shoe in south africa where holland came runners up at the world cup finals . as long as fatigue doesn ' t get the better of him , the 26 year old should continue to dominate serie a . milan ' s young brazilian pato showed flashes of brilliance last season including a brace against real madrid at the bernabeu but a succession of injuries meant it wasn ' t to be his season . this year the 2009 serie a young footballer of the year will be looking to improve on last term ' s 14 goal haul . if the 20 year old star , nicknamed the duck , can stay fit , then he and fellow brazilian ronaldinho could fire milan back into contention for the title in 2011 . october will mark the anticipated return of one of serie a ' s most talented players . banned for nine months following a failed doping test after a match against bari in 2009 , adrian mutu will resume the striking career that has seen him score an impressive 100 goals in 221 matches for fiorentina . should the troubled romanian be able to pick up where he left off then la viola have every chance of finishing in the top four . key clubs : once again , the title will be inter ' s to lose . the strength of their squad and experience of their new boss benitez will make it extremely difficult for the likes of roma and milan their only genuine rivals for the championship . having slipped to seventh place last season , juventus will be desperate to secure a top four spot and champions league football again . the likes of sampdoria , palermo and napoli who did so well to secure fourth , fifth and sixth place respectively last term will need to keep hold of their best players during the last days of the transfer window if they stand a chance of repeating their success . expert ' s view : gazzetta dello sport ' s tancredi palmeri "" after a clean sweep of trophies in 2010 , what can inter do for an encore ? in recent seasons , the nerazzurri have changed the game of prediction : it was just impossible to see past them retaining their title . not much has changed either . "" however , there are a couple of shadows over the san siro . the first is the exit of the jose the "" special one "" and the arrival of rafa benitez . the spaniard will hear whispers of "" would mourinho have done this ? "" follow every decision or substitution he makes . "" the second shadow is the possible return of the long haired swede , zlatan ibrahimovic . at the moment is not known if he will end up at ac milan inter ' s bitter , city rivals but the forecast for the coming season is clear : without ibra playing alongside pato and ronaldinho , inter are odds on to set the new italian record by winning their sixth title in a row . "" as for the others , juventus have been building a completely new squad . la vecchia signora have imported a sports director and coach from sampdoria and changed much of their playing staff . "" cannavaro , poulsen and diego have left aquilani , krasic , quagliarella have moved in . the transfers lack big name muscle but the bianconeri are working for the future . this season they will be satisfied with champions league qualification . "" roma are still too dependant on totti ' s performances . the old capitano is still good for 15 goals a season , but injuries are hampering his potency . adriano will also take a long time to settle and find his way through italian defenses . "" genoa had an impressive close season , signing toni , rafinha and the portugal goalkeeper eduardo . they could be the surprise of the season with their entertaining football ( the coach gasperini has been renamed "" gasperson "" in honor of his shared love of attacking tactics with alex ferguson ) . "" finally , napoli and palermo have exciting line ups but a shortage of replacements on the bench , and with the rough and tumble of the italian league this weakness will be exposed . "" my final serie a prediction in order of their final positions : inter , ac milan ( without ibra ) , juventus and roma in champions league . top scorers : samuel eto ' o ( he should play as pure forward this season ) or giampaolo pazzini ( the sampdoria number 9 who is due an international call up ) .

"whether browsing the web on internet explorer on a pc running windows or working up a powerpoint presentation with microsoft office before taking a break to game on the xbox , there are many among us whose entire digital experience have been filtered through products gates helped create . on tuesday , gates took what may be his final step away from leadership of microsoft . with the announcement that satya nadella , a 22 year veteran of the company , will take over as ceo , the company also said gates is stepping down as chairman of its board of directors . gates co founded the company with paul allen in 1975 but stepped down as ceo in 2000 . he then spent eight years as microsoft ' s chairman before stepping away from full time work there in 2008 to focus on his charitable work through the bill melinda gates foundation . rather than exiting the stage at the world ' s largest computer software company , gates may actually be getting more active . he ' ll take on a new role as an adviser to nadella , putting him back on microsoft ' s redmond , washington , campus more often . it will also put him nearer to the heart of innovation the company will need to keep up with rivals like apple and google at the top of the consumer tech industry . if he succeeds in helping microsoft get back its swagger , particularly in a fast growing mobile world dominated by apple and google and in the increasingly important field of cloud computing , it would be a final contribution to a career that has virtually defined an industry . "" bill gates is one of the pioneering giants of the information age , "" said merv adrian , a software and hardware analyst at gartner research . "" driven by the belief in a computer in every home , on every desktop , he helped to build one of the largest firms in the world to achieve that goal and arguably succeeded . "" for starters , microsoft was the world ' s first real software company . although there are hours of bare knuckle geek brawling to be done over whether gates and microsoft or rival steve jobs and apple were the true innovators on early computer interfaces , there ' s no question as to who succeeded in making software for the masses . the result was something approximating that computer on every desk dream . by making software a money maker for itself and third party developers , microsoft helped retailers sell computers for less , making them accessible to more of the public . whether it was ms dos for early ibm machines or the more seismic release of windows in 1985 , gates was behind them all . despite his reputation as an aggressive some would say predatory businessman , he has never been confused with a numbers guy who leaves the real work up to subordinates . gates wrote his first computer program , a tic tac toe game , at age 14 and formed his first company , again with allen , at 17 . in microsoft ' s early years , he wrote every line of code for the company ' s software while managing its business side . in that way , he set himself apart from rival steve jobs , who had a brilliant sense of design but was never much of a software engineer . gates ' exacting product reviews were legendary within microsoft , a fact that observers say puts him in a select fraternity of two in the computer world . "" the more time bill spends on product development , the better , "" geoffrey moore , author of the technology marketing book "" crossing the chasm , "" told the san francisco chronicle . "" he and steve jobs seem very different on the outside , but at their core , they were very similar . they both see things that others don ' t see , and they ' re both very demanding . "" as the years went on , microsoft products continued to become more ubiquitous so much so that the company ' s seeming stranglehold on the computing world led to monopoly claims and antitrust lawsuits in the late ' 90s and early 2000s . despite apple ' s inroads , windows continues to have more than 1 . 3 billion active users worldwide . powerpoint , part of the massively popular microsoft office suite of productivity tools , has joined the likes of kleenex , xerox and coke in the pantheon of brand names used synonymously with an entire category of products . many pc users have probably never created a document without microsoft word , and number crunchers everywhere would be lost without excel ' s spreadsheets . microsoft ' s hotmail , despite becoming seen as unfashionable by younger users , remained the world ' s most popular free e mail service until 2012 , when it was passed by gmail before microsoft merged it with outlook . and of course there ' s the xbox , which became one of the gaming industry ' s "" big three "" consoles , along with nintendo ' s wii and sony ' s playstation , upon its release in 2001 . thirteen years later , the new xbox one continues to do battle with the playstation 4 for the hearts and wallets of gamers . all were delivered under the guidance of gates . "" the pervasiveness of information technology was by no means clear when he began driving to it , "" adrian said . "" and today it is a fact of life , embedded into everyone ' s life to a degree that only science fiction writers imagined when he was building his first software . "" will gates ' new role mean a batch of new products that we ' ll still be talking about 10 or 20 years from now ? that may be a stretch . but in a video message posted online tuesday , gates said he ' ll be "" substantially increasing "" the time he spends at microsoft . and he sounds up to the challenge . "" microsoft has a long history of innovation , going back to the beginning , where the vision of the personal computer was something that microsoft helped bring to life , "" he said .

"mohamed abdeslam places candles on a window ledge of his family ' s apartment nov . 18 during a candlelight vigil in brussels ' molenbeek district town square . two of his brothers were among the attackers in paris on nov . 13 . they started praying more , and announced to the family that they had quit drinking . but that , said mohamed , seemed like something to celebrate . he thought his brothers were just maturing , he said that they had started to take their religion , and their lives , more seriously . "" when your brother tells you that he ' s stopped drinking , "" he told belgian television , "" it ' s not a change that says something is wrong . "" but in hindsight , the change appears to have had at least some connection to the nov . 13 attacks in paris , in which terrorists opening fire on caf s and a concert hall and detonating explosive vests killed 130 and wounded hundreds more . police now say brahim abdeslam died when he detonated a suicide vest inside a caf that night . his brother , salah , is the subject of an international manhunt the last time french officials saw him , he was crossing the border into belgium . brothers and terrorism have gone hand in hand for years . reid sawyer , who used to run the combating terrorism center at west point , said foreign fighters and jihadists often had close ties to other family members who had taken the same path , going back to the beginning of the iraq war . "" when you find one person that radicalizes in a family , it is a great predictor that somebody else in that family ? either immediately a brother or a cousin ? is likely to participate , "" he says .

"" it is not new , "" he says . "" in the study of terrorism it is very often the case that you are not , as an individual , radicalizing all by yourself . often it is a case that you radicalize due to small group dynamics ? kinship and friendship bonds .

"while senior administration officials have portrayed it as such , the jury is still out . if the government of libya is to be believed ( and there is reason to be skeptical ) the united states did not inform libya of its plan to capture al libi , much less ask permission . in fact , they have referred to his capture and swift removal from libya as a "" kidnapping . "" the more proper legal term for what the united states did to al libi is a "" rendition "" the abduction or forced removal of someone from their home country without administrative or judicial process , followed by transfer to another country . libya questions us ambassador over al libi capture if done without the consent of the host government , this is indeed a violation of that nation ' s sovereignty , but a much less serious one than conducting a drone strike or other use of military force . as for the detained individual , there is no remedy for such a violation . according to a 1992 us supreme court case , even an illegal rendition will not prevent a properly indicted defendant from being tried in federal court . and that is where al libi should be delivered in the near future . even if the united states did not inform libya of its plans , if the united states had evidence of ongoing involvement with al qaeda , the capture of al libi was justified under the laws of war . importantly , both secretary of state john kerry and secretary of defense chuck hagel expressed the propriety of the capture under the laws of war and the importance of the rule of law in conducting counterterrorism operations . according to a defense department statement , al libi is being "" lawfully detained under the law of war in a secure location outside of libya "" apparently a us navy warship in the mediterranean where he is being interrogated . the united states appears to be following the hybrid approach to counterterrorism developed in the case of ahmed abdulkadir warsame . warsame , a somalian , was captured by military forces on april 19 , 2011 , then held and subjected to intelligence interrogation , with no miranda warning , for more than two months aboard a us navy ship in the indian ocean , before being brought to the united states to face federal criminal charges . what the terror raids say about an ' obama doctrine ' warsame pleaded guilty in december 2011 to nine charges and has provided extensive cooperation to federal authorities , in an effort to receive a reduced sentence . the warsame case is an excellent example of how military , intelligence and law enforcement assets can be utilized to efficiently remove a terrorist threat from circulation in a legally supportable way while still eliciting valuable intelligence , and is a good template for the united states to follow in al libi ' s case . al libi was indicted in 2000 for his alleged role in the us embassy bombings in kenya and tanzania in 1998 and his involvement with al qaeda . interestingly , al libi was charged in the same indictment as ahmed ghailani . the differential treatment of these two alleged co conspirators demonstrates how us counterterrorism efforts have evolved from the bush administration to the obama administration . ghailani was captured in pakistan in july 2004 . when pakistani authorities transferred him to us custody , he was not brought to new york to face the federal indictment . rather , he was taken to a secret cia internment camp where he was subjected to a harsh cia interrogation regime for two years before being transferred to guantanamo in 2006 . ghailani was later charged before a military commission in guantanamo in october 2008 , just weeks before president obama was elected . these charges were dismissed in may 2009 when ghailani was transferred to the united states to face the federal charges . he was convicted in november 2010 , 6 years after his capture . ghailani was the only guantanamo detainee to be transferred to the united states for trial . although ghailani received a life sentence for his role in the african embassy bombings , some key evidence against him was suppressed by the federal district court judge because it had been acquired through coercion . this decision may have contributed to ghailani ' s acquittal on all but one of the dozens of charges in the indictment . ghailani ' s "" near acquittal "" played a significant role in congress ' decision to block the transfer of any further guantanamo detainees to the united states for any reason , including prosecution in federal court . because of this ill advised restriction , coupled with strict conditions imposed by congress limiting the transfer of detainees to third countries , the obama administration has wisely opted not to bring any new terrorism suspects to guantanamo . opinion : good thing us terrorist hunters weren ' t furloughed the president should resist calls , such as made in a recent wall street journal op ed , to bring al libi to guantanamo and try him before a military commission . such suggestions ignore the impact of recent us court of appeals rulings that have properly limited the charges that may be brought in military commissions , particularly for pre 2006 activity , to recognized international war crimes . based on the offenses listed in al libi ' s indictment , it is not at all clear that prosecution in a military commission is a viable option . secretary of defense hagel stated that the purpose of the targeted military operations this weekend in somalia and libya was "" to bring international terrorists to justice . "" the best chance to accomplish this is to find out what al libi knows through humane , noncoercive interrogation , then promptly bring him to trial in federal court in new york . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of david frakt .",1,senior administration officials portrayed  jury still  government libya believed  reason skeptical  united states inform libya plan capture al libi  much less ask permission  fact  referred capture swift removal libya  kidnapping   proper legal term united states al libi  rendition  abduction forced removal someone home country without administrative judicial process  followed transfer another country  libya questions us ambassador al libi capture done without consent host government  indeed violation nation  sovereignty  much less serious one conducting drone strike use military force  detained individual  remedy violation  according 1992 us supreme court case  even illegal rendition prevent properly indicted defendant tried federal court  al libi delivered near future  even united states inform libya plans  united states evidence ongoing involvement al qaeda  capture al libi justified laws war  importantly  secretary state john kerry secretary defense chuck hagel expressed propriety capture laws war importance rule law conducting counterterrorism operations  according defense department statement  al libi  lawfully detained law war secure location outside libya  apparently us navy warship mediterranean interrogated  united states appears following hybrid approach counterterrorism developed case ahmed abdulkadir warsame  warsame  somalian  captured military forces april 19  2011  held subjected intelligence interrogation  miranda warning  two months aboard us navy ship indian ocean  brought united states face federal criminal charges  terror raids say  obama doctrine  warsame pleaded guilty december 2011 nine charges provided extensive cooperation federal authorities  effort receive reduced sentence  warsame case excellent example military  intelligence law enforcement assets utilized efficiently remove terrorist threat circulation legally supportable way still eliciting valuable intelligence  good template united states follow al libi  case  al libi indicted 2000 alleged role us embassy bombings kenya tanzania 1998 involvement al qaeda  interestingly  al libi charged indictment ahmed ghailani  differential treatment two alleged co conspirators demonstrates us counterterrorism efforts evolved bush administration obama administration  ghailani captured pakistan july 2004  pakistani authorities transferred us custody  brought new york face federal indictment  rather  taken secret cia internment camp subjected harsh cia interrogation regime two years transferred guantanamo 2006  ghailani later charged military commission guantanamo october 2008  weeks president obama elected  charges dismissed may 2009 ghailani transferred united states face federal charges  convicted november 2010  6 years capture  ghailani guantanamo detainee transferred united states trial  although ghailani received life sentence role african embassy bombings  key evidence suppressed federal district court judge acquired coercion  decision may contributed ghailani  acquittal one dozens charges indictment  ghailani   near acquittal  played significant role congress  decision block transfer guantanamo detainees united states reason  including prosecution federal court  ill advised restriction  coupled strict conditions imposed congress limiting transfer detainees third countries  obama administration wisely opted bring new terrorism suspects guantanamo  opinion  good thing us terrorist hunters  furloughed president resist calls  made recent wall street journal op ed  bring al libi guantanamo try military commission  suggestions ignore impact recent us court appeals rulings properly limited charges may brought military commissions  particularly pre 2006 activity  recognized international war crimes  based offenses listed al libi  indictment  clear prosecution military commission viable option  secretary defense hagel stated purpose targeted military operations weekend somalia libya  bring international terrorists justice   best chance accomplish find al libi knows humane  noncoercive interrogation  promptly bring trial federal court new york  opinions expressed commentary solely david frakt ,government
"the mother to be , whose name is injaz , was cloned from the ovarian cells of a slaughtered camel in 2009 and born from a surrogate mother . injaz was six years old this week and is said to have conceived naturally . the world ' s first cloned camel is pregnant , scientists claim . the mother to be , whose name is injaz , was cloned from the ovarian cells of a slaughtered camel in 2009 and born by surrogate mother . injaz is pictured here when she was just six days old dr nisar wani , scientific director of the reproductive biotechnology centre in nad al sheba , dubai , told the national : ' we are very excited because injaz is now pregnant and we expect to have a calf from her late this year . ' she has conceived in a natural way . this will prove cloned camels are fertile and can reproduce the same as naturally produced camels . ' the birth of injaz , whose name means ' achievement ' in arabic , caused great excitement in 2009 and scientists said that cloning would help to preserve the genetics of the camel population . camels are a valuable commodity in the desert sheikdoms of the persian gulf , and are used for racing and transport . they can also produce low fat milk and can make owners millions of dollars at camel beauty contests . since injaz was born , many more animals have been produced by genetic cloning , including one from the cells of a camel beauty pageant winner . it ' s 19 years since the first mammal was cloned . dolly the sheep ( pictured ) was born in edinburgh using dna from an adult cell since injaz was born , many more animals have been produced by genetic cloning , including one from the cells of a camel beauty pageant winner , the bbc reported . it took five years of work before injaz was cloned . she was born on april 8 , 2009 weighing 66lbs ( 30kg ) , after an uncomplicated gestation of 378 days . the calf was created from cells harvested from the ovary of an adult camel . the cells were then planted into the egg of a surrogate mother . injaz was confirmed as genetically identical to the camel the cells were taken from , according to united arab emirates newspapers at the time . the world ' s first mammal was cloned 19 years ago . dolly the sheep was born in edinburgh

. human embryos have been genetically modified so that any changes made will be carried on into future generations for the first time , according to scientists . researchers around the world are bracing themselves for the results of a study by scientists in china that has introduced dna changes to reproductive cells . many scientists have already reacted with horror at the idea , for fear it could be misused to allow parents to ' select ' the genes they will pass on to their grandchildren . human embryos , like the one above , may have been genetically modified with new gene editing techniques they say that even embryos created in this way for research purposes only could have serious ethical and safety implications . they have described it as ' dangerous and ethically unacceptable ' . however , others argue that the technology could also be used to rid families of devastating inherited diseases like cystic fibrosis or certain cancers . until now scientists have concentrated on using genome editing techniques on somatic cells non reproductive cells like those found in skin , muscle , nerves , bone and liver for example to help them study diseases . modifying the dna of human embryos so that dna changes are preserved in the germline the sperm and eggs means such alterations can be passed on to future generations . such work is already illegal in many countries around the world including the uk , but is permitted in the us and china . a number of groups around the world are thought to be working on techniques to genetically modify human embryos

"kenneth palinkas , president of the national citizenship and immigration services council , warned in a rare public policy statement that america ' s immigration tensions are ' about to get exponentially worse and more dangerous ' if the federal government expands , as expected , the numbers of green cards and work permits it issues to foreign nationals . president  has promised to make a move on immigration policy this year , but his timetable and mechanics are a popular washington , d . c . guessing game whose ramifications touch on next week ' s election and the possibility of a december budget stalemate that could shut down the federal government . palinkas warned tuesday , however , that the state of play and his army of paper pushers are working in the president ' s favor .

' whether it ' s the failure to uphold the public charge laws , the abuse of our asylum procedures , the admission of islamist radicals , or visas for health risks , ' he said , public safety is already ' being endangered on a daily basis . ' palinkas is known inside the beltway as a consistent thorn in the side of democrats who want to expand work visa programs and create new guest worker designations , both of which were part of a senate immigration reform proposal that stalled in the house of representatives last year . the bill , which the white house shepherded through the senate with the help of a ' gang of eight ' lawmakers four democrats and four republicans would have attached those conditions to the gop ' s demands for more border security . it would also have put millions of illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship . when the house adjourns on december 12 , that legislation will be a dead letter . but obama has pledged to take action on his own if the capitol hill stalemate persists . part of that action may have been spelled out in a draft proposal published this month , which spelled out uscis ' s intention to purchase the paper stock required to produce as many as 34 million new documents a combination of work permits and ' green cards , ' the paperwork that authorizes immigrants to live and work in the united states . according to the solicitation , the agency will look for a company that can produce a minimum of 4 million cards per year for five years , and 9 million in the early stages . the company that wins the contract must be equipped to handle a ' potential "" surge "" in . . . demand for up to 9m ( 9 million ) cards during the initial period of performance to support possible future immigration reform initiative requirements , ' it reads . palinkas said tuesday that his union members are already seeing an increase in the numbers of interviews they are expected to complete , putting national security at risk . 34 million new cards : uscis has drafted a solicition for bids to sell the government enough raw materials to produce 34 million new green cards and work permits , including a ' surge ' of 9 million in the early days after a government policy shift ' there are plans , ' he warned , ' to waive interviews of applicants who seek adjustment of their status in the us to ready our workforce for the coming onslaught of applications unforeseen in previous administrations . ' americans , he said , should ' act now to ensure that congress stops this unilateral amnesty . let your voice be heard and spread the word to your neighbors . ' ' we who serve in our nation ' s immigration agencies are pleading for your help don ' t let this happen . ' it ' s unclear what republicans could do to counter the white house if the president decided to create new paperwork options for millions of people to emigrate to the us it ' s likely they will take over the us senate in january , but obama would be signing any executive order against the backdrop of a lame duck session of congress in which democrats would retain temporary control . it ' s also possible that senate races in georgia or louisiana could go to runoffs , leaving the senate gavel up in the air while obama readies his signature . if republicans do secure 51 or more senate seats on election day , they will hold most but not all the cards . the latest congressional budget resolution kept the government ' s bills paid through december 11 , a date that the president could hold over the gop ' s head in order to win immigration concessions . two political analysts , one who works with democrats and another who services republican clients , agreed in background conversations with mailonline that the white house will likely use the threat of a government shutdown as leverage , even if the democrats have already been demoted to a senate minority . republicans will need an uncharacteristic show of party unity , the two analysts agreed . a little busy with ebola : obama ( right ) originally said he would act on immigration by the end of the summer , but that deadline has now become an end of year mandate major constituency : immigrants ' rights groups are a large part of the democratic party , a faction the president can ' t afford to string along forever as the gop grooms new hispanic candidates to take the national spotlight ' the white house is really counting on disarray in the gop , ' the democratic operative said .

' i don ' t support it . it is wrong , ' priebus said . ' it is un american for a president to try and do such a thing . i want to make it clear : there is no part of me , there is not a molecule in my body that agrees with the president on executive amnesty . ' a republican campaign adviser told mailonline that obama will have to ' lick his wounds and take this one in the teeth if the democrats lose the senate . he ' s just not going to antagonize the majorities of both houses of congress with a massive immigration executive order .

' pr and branding : critics accuse the charity of taking money which could be better spent on food but the charge has sparked criticism from other charities and community groups . one foodbank volunteer leader said he saw ' no benefit paying 1 , 500 upfront to tt which could be used to buy food ' . last night , trust chief executive david mcauley said : ' the cost to the trussell trust of helping to start a new foodbank is higher than the contribution that the foodbank makes .

"having played a strangely lacklustre match on his last appearance in london the quarter final defeat to grigor dimitrov at sw19 he lobbed in a similarly curious performance to open the barclays atp world tour finals . except this one was even worse . whereas the bulgarian had excelled beyond himself on that summer afternoon kei nishikori did not even have to produce his best to win 6 4 6 4 and jeopardise murray ' s hopes for this week at the 02 arena . video scroll down for andy murray : i don ' t go into every match expecting to win kei nishikori won the first set 6 4 and began the second strongly , racing into a 3 0 advantage andy murray fought back to level 4 4 , but was unable to carry on his momentum against nishikori now he will surely have to win both his last two matches , starting tomorrow against canada ' s milos raonic , who let slip a set point on sunday night before going down 6 1 7 6 to a determined roger federer in the second match of group b . before subsiding 7 0 in the tiebreak the big serving raonic caused the swiss master sufficient problems to reinforce how dangerous he is . like nishikori , he was making his debut at this tournament and was nervous at the start . unlike the japanese player he was up against an opponent in federer who was ruthlessly sharp enough to take advantage from the off , rather than murray , who was reluctant to take the initiative . roger federer returns a forehand in his opening atp world tour finals match against milos raonic in london federer celebrates winning a point during the opening set while milos raonic puts the work in to make a return both opening matches drew an excess of 17 , 000 spectators , and those who packed the venue to its dimly lit rafters for the first session were to be reminded of an eternal truth about the 27 year old scot : for all his career achievements you are still never quite sure what you are going to get with him . not much , it turned out , on this occasion . he was desperately vulnerable on his serve and stuck so far back behind the baseline in the rallies there was a danger of him incurring a fee for parking . surprisingly sanguine afterwards , he dismissed the notion that the left calf muscle he had treated might have been a factor . ' i felt okay on the court today , i don ' t think that was the reason i lost the match , ' said murray . ' if this was anywhere else i would be out of the tournament . i ' m definitely going to have to play better if i am going to get through . ' nishikori had never beat murray before today and the japanese managed to silence his fans in london the japanese player was not hugely better than murray , but he stifled the scotsman ' s resurgence to beat him all his supporters can hope for now is that , with back to the wall , he shows the same resolve that drove him to play six consecutive weeks in asia and europe to qualify for this eight man field in the first place . you suspect he instinctively prefers to be in that situation anyway as he has never been a great front runner , which is what he might have considered himself to be against 02 new boy nishikori . murray ' s demeanour was certainly flat , despite the fact that he was given a rousing enough welcome , and his second serve took particular punishment . he denied afterwards suggestions on sunday from greg rusedski that he has made deliberate if subtle changes to his action since back surgery : ' i wouldn ' t have intentionally changed serve because i wasn ' t getting any problems with my back from my service action , ' he said . ' at the end of the year i will look at video from before and now to see if things have evolved . ' nishikori capitalised upon numerous mistakes on murray ' s second serve , as murray failed to settle murray fought back form 3 0 to 4 4 in the second set , but was unable to continue to build his momentum he is bound to be aware of minor changes in his ball toss already , and it is something he will have to review with head coach amelie mauresmo , who also has to fathom out a complex temperament that leaves him so prone to letdowns . in his previous match , against novak djokovic in paris ten days ago , he competed well before mentally tuning out and collapsing in the last five games . there was no sign of the resourcefulness or fight that carried him to three atp titles in six weeks , and also absent was any of the all court attacking intent she would like to instil in him . nishikori was there for the taking early on and could not a land a first serve in . he pretty much gifted murray a break to fall 3 2 behind but then had the donation reciprocated straightaway before the first set was dismally conceded . murray ' s next games are against roger federer and milos raonic and he will have to play much better a brief glimpse of attacking purpose was given when murray got back from 1 4 to 4 4 in the second , but he was broken again to lose the match with a backhand that went almost embarrassingly long beyond the baseline . a curious performance indeed . further down the scale , british number two james ward narrowly missed out on entering the world ' s top 100 for the first time when he lost 6 4 6 1 to australian john millman in final of the atp challenger in melbourne . the 27 year old londoner , who has now ended his season , is likely to go up to around 102 in the new rankings and already should be assured of a direct entry into january ' s

"political newcomer hassan sheikh mohamud , an academic and activist who has also worked for the united nations and other organizations , was sworn in the capital mogadishu after defeating incumbent president sheikh sharif sheikh ahmed . the milestone vote was hailed by the international community as a sign of improving security in a nation plunged into chaos after years of vicious civil hostilities . despite the move toward a more permanent government , the new president faces an uphill battle to rebuild the country and restore its shattered economy and crumbling infrastructure . even though insurgents have fled mogadishu and guns have fallen silent , portions of somalia still remain lawless as large parts of the country are under the control of militants , such as the al qaeda linked group al shabaab . distinguished somali professor ahmed ismail samatar , who also ran for president in the recent elections and is now a member of the new parliament , says the country ' s new leader is facing "" heavy challenges that need to be lifted .

"supplements of a popular energy booster could halve death rates among people with heart failure , claim scientists . the vitamin like supplement coenzyme q10 also reduces hospital admissions , says a major new study . it is the first drug shown to save the lives of heart failure patients in more than a decade and it is available over the counter in health food shops . coq10 which can be taken with statins should now be added to conventional treatment for such patients , according to professor svend aage mortensen , who led the study . professor mortensen said : ' coq10 is the first medication to improve survival in chronic heart failure since ace inhibitors and beta blockers more than a decade ago and should be added to standard heart failure therapy . ' other heart failure medications block rather than enhance cellular processes and may have side effects . ' supplementation with coq10 , which is a natural and safe substance , corrects a deficiency in the body and blocks the vicious metabolic cycle in chronic heart failure . ' more than 900 , 000 britons live with heart failure , which occurs when damage to the heart leaves it too weak to pump blood efficiently round the body . around 100 , 000 a year are thought to die from it . heart failure causes symptoms of fatigue , breathlessness , increased heart rate and swollen ankles , and it can lead to serious complications . coq10 is a substance similar to a vitamin which is made by the body and found in every cell , where it is used to produce energy . however , coq10 levels are decreased in the heart muscle of patients with heart failure , who are often taking statin drugs that in turn deplete the body ' s supplies still further . previous research has shown coq10 improves symptoms , functional capacity and quality of life in patients with heart failure with no side effects . but until now , no trials have been big enough to prove that supplements increase survival . the latest study from researchers at the university of southern denmark , copenhagen randomly allocated 420 patients with severe heart failure from a number of countries to coq10 or placebo a dummy drug and followed them for 2 years . heart failure causes symptoms of fatigue , breathlessness , increased heart rate and swollen ankles coq10 halved the risk of patients suffering death or serious deterioration of symptoms , including hospitalisation . altogether 29 ( 14 per cent ) patients in the coq10 group had such an event compared with 55 ( 25 per cent ) patients in the placebo group . coq10 also halved the risk of dying from all causes , which occurred in 18 ( 9 per cent ) patients in the coq10 group compared to 36 ( 17 per cent ) patients in the placebo group . the substance is essential to survival and as well as being important for energy production in cells , it also functions as an antioxidant , which protects the body from damage caused by harmful molecules . coq10 is naturally present in small amounts in a wide variety of foods , with higher levels in organ meats such as heart , liver , and kidney , as well as beef , soy oil , sardines , mackerel , and peanuts , but levels obtained through diet are insufficient to impact on heart failure . coq10 is available over the counter as a food supplement and many doctors advise patients on statins to take it as well in order to offset the cell energy depletion caused by statins . but professor mortensen cautioned : ' food supplements can influence the effect of other medications including anticoagulants and patients should seek advice from their doctor before taking them . ' he added : ' we have no controlled trials demonstrating that statin therapy plus coq10 improves mortality more than statins alone . ' nevertheless , he supported the use of coq10 by heart patients on statins because of their effect on supplies of the naturally occurring nutrient .",1,supplements popular energy booster could halve death rates among people heart failure  claim scientists  vitamin like supplement coenzyme q10 also reduces hospital admissions  says major new study  first drug shown save lives heart failure patients decade available counter health food shops  coq10 taken statins added conventional treatment patients  according professor svend aage mortensen  led study  professor mortensen said   coq10 first medication improve survival chronic heart failure since ace inhibitors beta blockers decade ago added standard heart failure therapy   heart failure medications block rather enhance cellular processes may side effects   supplementation coq10  natural safe substance  corrects deficiency body blocks vicious metabolic cycle chronic heart failure   900  000 britons live heart failure  occurs damage heart leaves weak pump blood efficiently round body  around 100  000 year thought die  heart failure causes symptoms fatigue  breathlessness  increased heart rate swollen ankles  lead serious complications  coq10 substance similar vitamin made body found every cell  used produce energy  however  coq10 levels decreased heart muscle patients heart failure  often taking statin drugs turn deplete body  supplies still  previous research shown coq10 improves symptoms  functional capacity quality life patients heart failure side effects   trials big enough prove supplements increase survival  latest study researchers university southern denmark  copenhagen randomly allocated 420 patients severe heart failure number countries coq10 placebo dummy drug followed 2 years  heart failure causes symptoms fatigue  breathlessness  increased heart rate swollen ankles coq10 halved risk patients suffering death serious deterioration symptoms  including hospitalisation  altogether 29  14 per cent  patients coq10 group event compared 55  25 per cent  patients placebo group  coq10 also halved risk dying causes  occurred 18  9 per cent  patients coq10 group compared 36  17 per cent  patients placebo group  substance essential survival well important energy production cells  also functions antioxidant  protects body damage caused harmful molecules  coq10 naturally present small amounts wide variety foods  higher levels organ meats heart  liver  kidney  well beef  soy oil  sardines  mackerel  peanuts  levels obtained diet insufficient impact heart failure  coq10 available counter food supplement many doctors advise patients statins take well order offset cell energy depletion caused statins  professor mortensen cautioned   food supplements influence effect medications including anticoagulants patients seek advice doctor taking   added   controlled trials demonstrating statin therapy plus coq10 improves mortality statins alone   nevertheless  supported use coq10 heart patients statins effect supplies naturally occurring nutrient ,health
